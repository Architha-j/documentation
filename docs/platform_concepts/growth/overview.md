---------------------

## 1. Track sources of user traffic

Number of **Users, Messages, Sessions and Session duration** is used to identify user traffic. 
Benchmarking is done by calculating the same metric over the selected duration as well as for a similar duration before the start date. Selected duration and previous duration are then compared.
The bold line represents the metric for the current duration and the dotted line represents metrics for the previous duration.

> User traffic is calculated for all the channels.

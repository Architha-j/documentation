Dashboards are useful for organizing and analyzing data based on common themes. For example, if your company has three different types of products and you want to check the analytics for each product separately but in the same place, you can create dashboards for each product and add relevant metrics to each dashboard. This allows you to view all the connected values under one view.

You can have multiple dashboards, and each dashboard can contain multiple widgets.

:::note
Actions in Dashboard must be configured separately for **Live and Production** environment.
:::

To view the Dashboards page, on the left navigation bar, click **Insights > Dashboards**.
You can find **Default** and **Custom** dashboard tabs.

You can perform various actions on the available tables in Data Explorer to view the data as per your requirements. These actions include:
1. Filtering columns
2. Summarizing and grouping table details
3. Visualizing summarized data in various pictorial charts.

Earlier in this section, we discussed filtering data, and now we will focus on summarizing data tables. 
The summarization feature provides several options to summarize, group by, and perform advanced data analytics on default tables or tables generated by writing a custom query.

:::note
All the operations selected will be applied to all the columns in the table, not just the visible columns on the page.

## 1. Summarize and group by

> Summarize options are available based on the selected subscription models. 

In this panel, you can **Summarise** the datasets/tables by a count of the table data (number of rows) and **Group by** the column fields.

### Summarize by

1. On the tables page (default datasets/custom datasets), click **Summarize**.

2. Click **Add metrics** to explore the available summary options.

3. Dataset can be summarized(grouping Rows) by selecting a Column Name, and selecting required metrics like count, the sum of, an average of, the number of distinct values of, minimum of, and/or maximum of.

4. Click **Apply**.


:::note
Remove filters when the data is summarized.

### Group by

1. Records can be grouped by a specific column. Select the column name (multiple column names can be selected). 
2. Click **Apply**.

3. Records can be listed page wise defining the number of records per page. Records can be sorted in ascending and descending order by a specific column.  
4. Click on the column label to sort the data.

## 2. Advanced analysis available on summarized tables

Insights module provide users with advanced data analysis capabilities using basic arithmetic operations and pivot table features. This eliminates the need for users to exit the platform for basic data analysis and calculations.


### Total value of each column

By default, all summarized tables in Data Explorer display a **Total** at the end of each column. The type of **Total** displayed depends on the data type of the column:
* For columns with **Integer** data type, the Total displayed will be the sum of all the values in the column.
* For columns with **non-integer** data type, the Total displayed will be the unique count of values in the column.
* If you have applied **Count, Sum, or Distinct** operations while summarizing data, the Total displayed will be the *sum* of values in the column.
* If you have applied **Min, Max, or Average** operations while summarizing data, the *Total* value will be empty.

### Add formulas(arithimetic operations) to columns

You have the ability to add formulas using arithmetic operators to the required columns to quickly calculate results. This feature allows you to perform calculations without leaving the platform. 
You can simply select the desired columns, add the formula using arithmetic operators, and apply it to calculate the results. This feature saves time and enhances your ability to analyse data efficiently in Data Explorer.

### Pivot data tables

Pivot tables are a powerful feature that can help you summarize, sort, and analyse large amounts of data quickly and efficiently. With a pivot table, you can create a new table that allows you to rearrange and summarize your data by switching the rows for a base column. This feature enables you to easily analyse and understand complex data sets and identify trends, patterns, and insights that may be difficult to spot in a traditional table format.

> This feature is available for **Saved reports**. Read more [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dataexplorer/savedreportsactions#5-pivot-a-report).

## 4. Save queries as reports

These summarized queries can be used for future references and they will be available for quick use on the data explorer page(under **Saved reports**), click the **Save query** option available at the top of the page.

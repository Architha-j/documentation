When you click on **Save query** on the tables page, you can create saved reports that include filters, summarization, and visualisation. These saved reports can be scheduled for automatic alerts, can be used for advanced data analytics, added to a dashboard for easy access, or downloaded/deleted as needed. 

You can find your **Saved reports** at the top of the data explorer section.

## 1. Schedule a report

Scheduling a recurring report (instead of downloading the CSV files and monitoring dashboards) is important because it provides consistency, efficiency, reliability, and flexibility. It ensures timely and accurate delivery of information while freeing up time and resources.

To schedule a report, follow the below steps: 
1. Saved queries are available as saved reports on the data explorer page, open any of your saved reports. For example: Studio feedback.

    - **Frequency**: You can choose hourly, weekly (select the days of the week that the report needs to be sent on), monthly or quarterly (choose timezone and dates).
    - **Email**: Specify the email IDs of the recipients to which the report needs to be sent. You can add up to a maximum of 10 email IDs (they can also be external to your organization).
    - **Subject**: Subject is pre-filled with the report name.
    - **Message**: Type in a message that you want to add to the body of the email.

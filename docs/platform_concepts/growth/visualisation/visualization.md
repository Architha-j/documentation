Using charts, graphs, dashboards, and other visualizations is an effective way to make your data more accessible and engaging in real-world discussions. 


## Types of visualisation


| Chart Type      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Line Chart**  | Suitable for visualizing trends over time. Ideal for displaying changes in a variable, such as stock prices of a company, over a period of time.                                                                                                 |
| **Bar Chart**   | Effective in comparing data across different categories. Ideal for comparing the sales of various products in a store.                                                                                                                               |
| **Row Chart**   | Similar to a bar chart, used to compare data across categories, but with horizontal bars instead of vertical ones. Ideal when category labels are long, such as comparing performance of different departments in a company.                   |
| **Funnel Chart**| Useful for showing the progression of data through different stages. Suitable for displaying the conversion rate of website visitors to leads, leads to prospects, and prospects to customers.                                                 |
| **Count Chart** | Great for displaying the frequency of values in a dataset. Ideal for showing how frequently each letter appears in a block of text.                                                                                                               |
| **Pie Chart**   | Excellent choice for representing how a whole is divided into parts. Useful for illustrating the proportion of expenses in a household budget.                                                                                                    |
| **Pivot Table** | Essential for summarizing and visualizing large datasets efficiently. Offers flexibility in rearranging data and enabling interactive exploration.                                                                                               |

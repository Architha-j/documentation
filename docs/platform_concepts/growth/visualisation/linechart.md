**Sample use case:** 

A line graph could be utilized to monitor the sales performance of a particular product category over time. Let's consider a clothing store that sells various types of apparel, including shirts, pants, and accessories. By creating a line graph, the store can track the monthly sales figures for each product category over the course of a year.
This line graph would display each product category as a separate line, with the x-axis representing time (e.g., months) and the y-axis representing sales revenue or units sold.

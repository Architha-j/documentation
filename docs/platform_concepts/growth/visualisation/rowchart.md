**Sample use case:** 

In a retail business, a row chart can be employed to visualize sales performance across various product categories. Each horizontal bar represents a product category, with the length of the bar indicating the revenue generated by that category. This visualization allows retailers to quickly identify the best-selling categories and prioritize resources accordingly for inventory management and marketing strategies.

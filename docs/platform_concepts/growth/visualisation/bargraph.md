Bar charts represent data through horizontal rectangular bars, where the length of each bar corresponds to the value of the data it represents.
 
Stacked bar graphs visually represent data by stacking individual bars (in different color) to show the total while illustrating the contribution of each category. This format aids in part-to-whole comparisons, trend analysis, and efficient presentation of data with multiple categories. It's effective for emphasizing both total values and the significance of individual components, making it a useful tool for various data visualization scenarios.

When you click **Visualisation > Bar graph**, you will get the following options to select the values to be displayed on the X and Y axis of the bar graph.

- **X-axis:** Select fields from **Group by** for the X axis.
- **Y-axis:** Select fields from **Summarise by** for the Y axis.

:::note
- You can have a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 2 *group bys*. *Group bys* can be rearranged, which will change the nesting.
- You can have a minimum and a maximum of 1 *summarise by*.

After selecting the values, you will get the option to **stack** the bar graph:

- **Don't stack:** The bar graphs are not stacked.

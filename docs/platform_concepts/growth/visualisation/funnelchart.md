A funnel chart is a type of graph that represents data in a funnel-shaped manner, where values are progressively narrowed down from the top to the bottom. It's typically used to visualize stages of a process or conversion funnel, showing the relative size or proportion of data at each stage.

**Sample use case:**

In sales or marketing funnel charts can be used to track the customer journey from initial leads to final conversions. For instance, a company may use a funnel chart to illustrate the progression of website visitors to leads, then qualified leads, and finally to actual sales. This visualization helps businesses identify potential bottlenecks or drop-off points in the conversion process, allowing them to optimize their strategies for better results.

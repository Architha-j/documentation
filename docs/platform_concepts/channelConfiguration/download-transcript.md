You can allow your bot users to download chat transcripts in a plain text (.txt) format directly from the chat widget. This facilitates bot users to access their complete conversation history with the bot.

The downloaded chat transcripts include information such as the bot's name, user's name, timestamp (displaying the full date and time), and the messages exchanged between the bot, agent, and user. 

Following are the important points for downloading chat transcripts:

* This is supported for web bots, PWA, and SDK.
* It supports multiple languages.
* Available only for the ongoing session (within 24 hours of chat initiation).
 
By default, this option is enabled. To download the chat transcript, preview the chat widget and click the below-highlighted option, then select **Download transcript**.

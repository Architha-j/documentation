### Create product catalog on Facebook

The Facebook Commerce Manager (FCM) helps in listing the products to be used for SPM (Single Product Message) or MPM (Multi Product Message). It is not possible to send any product on WhatsApp without listing the products on the FB's Commerce Manager.

:::note
To use catalog, it's mandatory for the businesses to have a business manager account with Catalog.
:::


To create a Catalog in FB Commerce Manager for your Business:

1. Log on to [Facebook Business Manager](https://business.facebook.com/settings) and go to **Business Settings**. Use the client's BM to create Production Catalogs.

2. Navigate to **Data Sources** and click on **Catalog**.

3. Select **Add** > **Create a New Catalog**.

   * If this will be your first catalog, click Get Started. Select **Create a catalog** and then click **Get Started**.
   * If you already have at least one catalog, you will see all of your catalogs listed. Select **+ Add Catalog** to create a new one.

4. Select the type of inventory you advertise or sell, then click **Next**.

5. Choose how you want to add items to your catalog - Upload product info or Connect a partner platform.

6. Select the Business Manager account that your catalog belongs to. This unlocks more ways to use your catalog than selecting a personal account and enables you to assign other people permission to work on the catalog. To select a Business Manager account, you must be a [business admin](https://en-gb.facebook.com/micro_site/url/?click_from_context_menu=true&country=IN&destination=https%3A%2F%2Fen-gb.facebook.com%2Fbusiness%2Fhelp%2F442345745885606&event_type=click&last_nav_impression_id=2bDTYoj64VaSUC2PQ&max_percent_page_viewed=52&max_viewport_height_px=711&max_viewport_width_px=1437&orig_http_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&orig_request_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fen-gb.facebook.com%2Fbusiness%2Fhelp%2F1275400645914358&primary_cmsid=1275400645914358&primary_content_locale=en_GB&region=apac&scrolled=true&session_id=1QKGQufmtkRFBOVm3&site=fb4b&extra_data[view_type]=v3_initial_view&extra_data[site_section]=help&extra_data[placement]=%2Fbusiness%2Fhelp%2F1275400645914358).

7. Enter a name for your catalogue and click **Create**.

Once the Catalog is created, you can go to the Commerce Manager available on the top right and manage your Catalog from the Commerce Manager Dashboard.

You can add products to the Catalog either manually or through a [Data Feed](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1898524300466211?id=725943027795860). 

An ideal way to manage your products is through Data Feed as it allows adding products with complete information using a CSV file, and sync the data through the Commerce Manager (CM). 

You can automate the sync based on your preferred cadence such as Hourly, Daily etc. To find the CSV headers and supported values on the Data Feed, see [here](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/120325381656392?id=725943027795860).

It is important to note the following points in Catalog before using its products:

1. ContentID can be given from the business side or will be generated automatically from FB side. This ID needs to be unique and will be used as Product ID in the WhatsApp product message node.
2. It takes some time to update products when syncing the catalogs using the data feed. You cannot send products on WhatsApp until this process is completed.
3. For Businesses in India, it is mandatory to have these fields (origin_country, importer_name, and importer_address) filled in as per field specification before each product can be used as SPM/MPM. 
4. You can add the field values (origin_country, importer_name, and importer_address) in the CSV file or use a Data Rule to fill the values by default from the Data Feed settings page.

### Link Catalog to a WhatsApp business account

Once the Catalog is set up, the business has to share the Catalog access with the BSP (Yellow.ai) to use items from the Catalog in WABA accounts created by Yellow. 

To share Catalog access with the BSP and connect it to WABA - 

1. On the client's BM, go to **Catalog**  and select **Assign Partner**.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/BCh7ZBZ.png)


2. Enter the BSP's (yellow.ai’s) BM ID to link to the Catalog of the business.

3. The Businesses Catalog should show the BSPs name as a partner for the Catalog. Provide Manage Catalog Permission.

4. Once the access is shared, the BSP will get the Catalog listed at their end, as shown below.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/XEcYZTy.png)


5. After getting access, the BSP has to link the Catalog to the WABA. To do this, the BSP has to go to the **Phone Number** page on the WABA account on BM, click on the **Cart** icon on the left pane, and then choose the Catalog that needs to be linked.

   <img src="https://i.imgur.com/5oJrzpP.png" width="70%"/>


6. Your Catalog should appear in the connected catalog list. This confirms that the Catalog is ready to be used on the WABA and the Phone number attached to this WABA.

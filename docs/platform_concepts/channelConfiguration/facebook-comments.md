Integrating Facebook comments with the Yellow.ai Cloud platform helps automate responses to comments on your Facebook posts seamlessly. 

This saves you from the tedious task of individually responding to each comment. Additionally, it improves user engagement and ensures prompt replies to inquiries and feedback.

With FB comments integration, you can engage in seamless two-way conversations.

:::note
Facebook Messenger and Facebook comments function as separate communication channels.

The FB comments integration offers these features: 

* **Automated replies to user comments:** It automatically responds to user comments and effectively manages conversations within each comment using bot flows.
* **Multi-user conversations:** When multiple users respond to a single comment, their responses are consolidated within the same conversation thread.

* **New conversations stand out:** When a new user comments separately, it starts a new conversation thread within the same comment.

## Setup your bot

Before you start testing your bot, setup your bot with intents to automatically respond to user comments on your Facebook posts, as explained below.

* **Define bot's purpose and scope**: First, understand the scope and purpose of your bot (use case). Clearly outline what types of questions or requests the bot should handle based on your intended use case.
* **[Create Intents](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/train/intents)**: Include the intents for common questions or requests. Add the utterances to each intent and train them to trigger the respective flow.
* **[Create flows](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/Flows/journeys)**: Design customized conversation flows to manage responses to your FB posts. You can incorporate text, images, and file prompts within the flow. While quick replies are supported, they will be displayed as plain text in the bot's responses.

Once you set up the bot, verify whether the bot effectively handles and responds to user comments according to the defined expectations.

## Test your bot on Facebook page

Once you have linked your bot to your Facebook page through the Yellow.ai platform, you need to test the bot to verify whether the bot  is able to respond to user comments on your Facebook page automatically.

To test your bot on Facebook page, follow these steps:

1. Open your Facebook account and navigate to your business page.

2. Add a comment to the Facebook page post to test the chatbot. Ensure that you have created the bot with intents and configured the flows with the same intent.

* When a user adds a comment to the post, if the intent matches, the bot should be able to understand the utterance and respond automatically.

* If the intent does not match, the bot should be able to respond with a fallback message. 
   
3. If a flow is configured for agent reply using theÂ [raise ticket](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/action-nodes#17-raise-ticket) node to start a conversation with an agent, it initiates a conversation with the agent. Once a conversation is initiated, the user can talk to the agent.

4. To view the entire conversation between the live agent and user, navigate to the **Inbox** module in the platform and select **Bot messages** in the **My Chats** section.

* When the conversation between the agent and user ends, the bot takes the conversation forward with the user.

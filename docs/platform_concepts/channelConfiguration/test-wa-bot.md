The following table provides a list of supported and unsupported message formats for testing:

Supported message types | Unsupported message types
------------ | ------------
Text | Single/Multi Product Message
Media - image, document, video | Cart Events for SPM/MPM
WhatsApp Quick Replies | WhatsApp Pay
WhatsApp List Messages | WhatsApp template Quick Replies


To initiate testing, follow these steps:

1. Enter the testing number provided by Yellow.ai or use your personal number.
2. [Build your bot](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/Getting%20Started/create-a-bot) with the required conversational flows based on your use case.
3. Test the WA bot using either Studio or Channels module. 

    * Use the Preview section of the Studio module.

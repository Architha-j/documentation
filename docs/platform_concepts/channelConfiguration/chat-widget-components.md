The platform allows you to add components to the chat widget so that the user experience is not limited to plain text. 
There are two types of components - **Interactive** and **Non-Intercative**. Click [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/channelConfiguration/character-limits-sdk) to know more about the limitations of the components.

Let's take an example, where you want to register for an online class through a website. With the help of date and time picker components in the chatbot, you can register quickly by providing the appropriate date and time instead of manually typing the text messages.

:::note
Each of these components supports both light and drak back ground theme.

## 1. Interactive messages

This type of message allows you to make a quicker selection from a menu when interacting with a bot. It allows the user to actively interact with the chatbot by clicking buttons, menus, or custom actions.

Following are the types of interactive message components:

### 1.1 Quick replies 
|     |  |
|---------|-------|
| This component allows you to reply to the bot with the pre-defined buttons. When your user clicks on any of the quick reply buttons, a message is sent into the conversation. Click <a href="https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/prompt-nodes#14-quick-replies">here</a> to implement Quick replies using a node. | <img src="https://i.imgur.com/y7JESen.png" alt="drawing" width="100%"/>

### 1.2 Multi select
|     |  |
|---------|-------|
| This is similar to quick replies. It consists of multiple quick reply buttons where the user can select multiple options at once to send the response to the chatbot.

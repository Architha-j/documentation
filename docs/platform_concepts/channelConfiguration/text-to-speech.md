The chat widget supports Text-to-Speech (TTS) feature that enables chatbots to convert text into audio. This helps to make the conversation between a user and the bot more interactive. TTS allows the chatbot to respond to users in a natural way, using a synthesized voice to provide a human-like conversation experience.  The bot responds to the user's queries with a human voice and provides additional information and feedback.

TTS is a paid feature. You need to upgrade to enterprise subscription to access this feature. To enable TTS for your chatbots, contact [support](mailto:support@yellow.ai).

:::note
* TTS currently supports Arabic (Saudi), Arabic (UAE), Bengali, English (India, Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, and United States), French, Gujarati, Hindi, Indonesia, Kannada, Marathi, Malayalam, Malay (Malaysia), Tamil, Telugu, Urdu (Pakistan), and Vietnamese.

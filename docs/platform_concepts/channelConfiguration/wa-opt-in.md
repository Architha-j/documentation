### WhatsApp opt-out

WhatsApp opt-out is a process where users have the ability to unsubscribe or stop receiving communications from a business on WhatsApp. By opting out, the user will no longer receive messages, updates, or notifications through WhatsApp.

You should provide clear instructions for users to opt out of WhatsApp communications and modify their preferences if desired.

To ensure an effective WhatsApp opt-out process, consider the following:
- Include a clear instruction in the template footer: "Type STOP to stop receiving WhatsApp messages."
- Implement a separate flow to handle opt-outs.
- Create an intent for the keyword "STOP" and connect it to the opt-out flow.
- Use the variable node to update the value of the CDP variable "opt-in" to "false" for the user opting out.
- When sending campaigns, target only users with an "opt-in" status set to "true".

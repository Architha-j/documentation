Domain whitelisting allows you to secure your chatbot and ensures that the chatbot can be accessed only in authorized domains. It prevents unauthorized users from copying the script and embedding the bot on their websites or mobile applications. 

Yellow.ai allows businesses to whitelist a list of domains to host their chatbot on a particular website. Let's say you want a list of domains where you can load the bots so that other website users cannot copy the script and use the bot on their websites. In such a case, you can whitelist the respective domain.

:::note
* When a domain (example: yellow.ai) is whitelisted, all its subdomains (example: cloud.yellow.ai, live.yellow.ai) will also be included by default.
* By default, Yellow.ai and Yellow Messenger are whitelisted to allow you to preview your chatbot.

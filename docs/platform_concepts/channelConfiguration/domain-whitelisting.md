Domain whitelisting allows you to secure your chatbot and ensures chatbot acces only in authorized domains. It prevents unauthorized users from copying the script and embedding the bot on their websites and Mobile SDK apps (Android and iOS apps). 

Yellow.ai allows businesses to whitelist domain(s) where you want to deploy the chatbot.

:::note
* When a domain (example: yellow.ai) is whitelisted, all its subdomains (example: cloud.yellow.ai, live.yellow.ai) will also be whitelisted by default.
* Yellow.ai and yellowmessenger.com are whitelisted by default to allow you to preview your chatbot seamlessly.

## Whitelist Mobile apps

The platform supports whitelisting for bots deployed using all SDK frameworks, including Android, iOS, React Native, Cordova, and Flutter. By default, the bot will load on any app where the SDK is integrated. If you choose to whitelist one or more apps, the bot will exclusively load in the whitelisted app.

To whitelist specific apps, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Secure bot** tab and expand the drop-down corresponding to **App**.

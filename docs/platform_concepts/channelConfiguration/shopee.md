Shopee is an e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia where businesses can sign up for a seller account to sell their products directly to users.

Connecting Shopee to Yellow.ai enables live agent support for users to respond and view clicked products during the chat.

As per Shopee's documentation guidelines, automated chatbot replies are not supported. The recommended approach is to use the Shopee channel for interactions between users and live agents. This ensures that all interactions are handled by human agents rather than automated bots.

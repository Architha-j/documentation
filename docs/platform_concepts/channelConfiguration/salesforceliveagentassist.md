## Salesforce agent assist features 

### Chat summariztion 

Agents can improve their productivity by leveraging a Generative AI-powered Inbox to summarize customer conversations. They can quickly access summaries of past interactions instead of going through individual conversations to provide contextual customer support. 

Supervisors can also benefit from this feature by obtaining a summary of customer interactions. The chat is automatically summarized each time the customer sends a reply/message. Click *Download transcript* to download the chat/summary.

### Real-time reply suggestions 

Agents can now receive real-time message suggestions to speed up customer response times. This feature helps agents avoid making errors by providing them with accurate information and suggested responses. As a result, it can help reduce the number of callbacks and escalations, while also improving the overall quality of customer service.
You can copy and paste the text and edit it before sending it to the customer, or you can send an auto-generated response.

### Knowledgebase search results (Help)

With all the input provided to the bot/app, you will have a help portal that will provide solutions to the query you type. From the knowledge base provided, answers are generated. This feature allows you to search for queries and get summarized answers along with reference links. It offers easy customizability to create a knowledge base in accordance with company branding. 

You gain access to a self-serve library of internal documents, manuals, datasheets, and more for agents. This facilitates faster agent onboarding without increasing training costs, as well as suggesting relevant knowledge articles for agents.

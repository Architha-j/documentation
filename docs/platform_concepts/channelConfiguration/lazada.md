Lazada is an e-commerce platform operating in Southeast Asia. It provides an online marketplace for sellers to sell their products to users.

Connecting Lazada to Yellow.ai facilitates automated bot responses and live agent support. Users can seamlessly engage, receive responses, and view clicked products during their chat interactions.

## Supported message types
 
The Lazada channel supports the following message types for interactions between agents/bots and users:

 agent/bot to user | user to agent/bot | 
------------|---------------|
   text<br/>image | text<br/> Image<br/>video
   
#### Limitations 

* External links cannot be shared by the user. ![](https://i.imgur.com/ASnz6dw.png)
* The Doc Cog functionality is not supported due to the inability to include external links in messages.
* Disconnecting the integration on the Yellow end will not automatically remove the webhook subscription. Users need to de-authorize the app on their end separately.

:::note
To ensure uninterrupted service, it is essential to reconnect this channel every 6 months, as Lazada authorization keys expire periodically.

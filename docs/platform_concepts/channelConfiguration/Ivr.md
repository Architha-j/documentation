All the bots created after July 2022 operate on the cloud. Refer to [this](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/channelConfiguration/ivr-bots) article for the latest update.
:::

Interactive Voice Response (IVR) channel can be deployed and hosted in a cloud environment. Configuring IVR bots on the cloud allows businesses to deliver an efficient and personalised customer experience.

While building voice bots, you need to link the bot to a phone number so that when users call this number, they can have a conversation with the bot.

Once you have built the personalized voice bot, you need to connect your voice bot with a number to enable interactive voice responses.

  
:::note
- The associated number will be used for making (an outbound) call or receiving (an inbound) call.
- This is a paid feature. You need to upgrade to enterprise subscription to access this feature. To enable this feature for your bots, contact [support](mailto:support@yellow.ai).
- Phone numbers are a limited resource and are leased from downstream providers at a monthly cost. Ensure that only the required phone numbers are being added to the bot.

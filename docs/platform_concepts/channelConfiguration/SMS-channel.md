SMS (Short Message Service) is a messaging channel that enables sending of text messages to users through registered phone numbers.

Integrating SMS with the Yellow.ai Cloud platform allows for automated text-based conversations with users, supporting both one-way and two-way interactions for active engagement.

Through SMS, you can send campaigns and inform customers about discounts, sales, or special offers. You can also connect the SMS channel to the live agent.

The SMS channel integration enables the following benefits:

* **Automated replies**: Enables automatic responses to user messages received via SMS.
* **One-way conversation**: Supports one-way communication where only the sender shares information and recipients cannot respond. Such messages include promotional offers, transactional updates, alerts, or notifications.
* **Two-way conversation**: Supports two-way communication, allowing both sender and recipient to exchange conversations. These messages can include messages such as live agent support, automated replies, order tracking, or feedback.
* **Supported message types**: To interact with users, it supports both text and image message types.

To send SMS using one-way or two-way communication depends on the regulations, guidelines, or requirements set by the each country.

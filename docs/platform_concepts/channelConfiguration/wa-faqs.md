Template messages must be pre-approved by WhatsApp and can be done from the WATI dashboard. All template messages must adhere to WhatsApp Commerce Policies.

<p>

Facebook has some guidelines to be followed for display name to be approved. A display name must have consistent branding with external sources(e.g., a company's website or marketing).
If they don't feel the display name is abiding all these rules, then they will approve the display name.

- For instance: Facebook account of the client is in the name of Tolaram Grp and display name "Colgate" is rejected by Facebook saying there is no link between the two names. So client has to apply for new account under the name of "Colgate Nigeria."

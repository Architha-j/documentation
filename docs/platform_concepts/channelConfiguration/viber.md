## Viber links

Viber links are URLs that are used to initiate conversations with your business account on the Viber messaging app. Viber links are similar to [deep links](https://developers.viber.com/docs/tools/deep-links/) and are designed to provide a seamless user experience. Clicking these links directs users to specific interactions within the Viber app.

You can get the Viber links manually by appending your chatbot username to the Viber deep link.

To get the Viber links, follow these steps:

1. Open Viber app and navigate to **More** > **Settings**.

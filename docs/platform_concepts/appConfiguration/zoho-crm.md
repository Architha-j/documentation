Integrate your yellow.ai platform with your [Zoho CRM](https://www.zoho.com/en-in/crm/) account to create, update and search for records in your Zoho CRM modules.

:::note
In Zoho CRM, data is categorized into groups or divisions based on similarity. Each division that has similar data is called a **module**. For example, Leads is a module that contains all your business leads' details.
:::

## 1. Connect Zoho CRM with Yellow.ai

To connect your Zoho CRM account with Yellow.ai, follow these steps:

1. Go to cloud.yellow.ai and click **Integrations** on the module switcher.

3. Click **Connect to Zoho-CRM** button and log in to your Zoho CRM account in the following pop-up to establish this integration. 
4. If you have multiple accounts, follow the above mentioned steps to add each of them.

:::note
1. Enter a unique name for each account to easily identify them within the yellow.ai platform. It is recommended to use a name that aligns with its purpose for better usability. 
2. You can add a maximum of 5 merchant accounts.
3. In a two-tier environment, such as bots with only Development/Live environments, you can add account names only in the development mode. Once added and flows have been built, in the Live mode, you can only choose the account names and not edit them.
4. In a three-tier environment, such as bots with Staging/Sandbox/Production modes, in Staging and Sandbox modes, you can add and edit new accounts. However, in Production, only the account details added in Staging will be available. You can only map in the production environment.

## 2. Payload to access Zoho CRM on app.yellow.ai 

```
app.executeIntegrationAction({
        "action": <NODE TO BE EXECUTED>,
        "dynamicParams": {
    "context": [{
       "key": "objects",
       "value": <VALUE OF OBJECT SELECTED>,
       "label": <VALUE LABEL OF OBJECT SELECTED>,
       "nextStep":"fields"
   }],
   "botId": <BOT ID>,
   "integrationName": "zoho-crm",
   "nodeName": <NODE NAME>,
   "source": <SOURCE>,
   "sender": <SENDER>,
   "dynamicParams": {
       <VALUES TO BE POPULATED>
   }
}})

```
:::note
Yellow.ai adopts a secure approach towards client credential storage, whereby it refrains from storing the said credentials. Instead, it utilizes the oAuth 2.0 to integrate with the client's Zoho account. During the integration, Yellow.ai directs the user to log in to their Zoho CRM account and seek authorization to access the account on Yellow.ai. This process ensures optimal security and eliminates any potential risks associated with the storage of client credentials.

## 3. Use-case

Through this integration you can create and update all the standard records in your Zoho CRM account.

:::note
When multiple accounts are added, select the appropriate account for each node, allowing you to leverage the unique functionalities of each account for their intended purposes.
:::

1. In the [Studio flow builder](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/Flows/journeys), choose the node type as **Integrations** and select **Zoho CRM** from the list of integrations that have been enabled for that particular bot. An **Integration Action Node** will be added to the flow builder.

To carry out a [certain action](#supported-zoho-crm-actions-with-yellowai) in your Zoho CRM account, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Automation** and [create a flow](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/Flows/journeys#2-create-a-flow) based on your requirement.

3. In the **Zoho CRM** node, fill the following:

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/UeuaTVh.png)

* **Account name:** Choose the Zoho CRM account. If you have only one account, the account name is automatically populated. If you have multiple accounts, the first account added is auto-populated. Select the one you want to use at that moment.
* **Action:** Choose the [action](#supported-zoho-crm-actions-with-yellowai) to be performed.
* **Select Objects:** Choose the Zoho CRM module in which the chosen action should be performed.
* Depending on the selected object, the corresponding fields will be shown. To fill those fields, you need to collect it as an input from users beforehand. Construct the flow accordingly and [store the data in variables](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/bot-variables#41-store-data-in-variables). These variables will then be passed in those fields.


4. Each Zoho CRM action returns a response as a JSON object. [Store that response in an object variable](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/bot-variables#41-store-data-in-variables) and to extract the required information from the payload,  [pass that variable](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/bot-variables#42-retrieve-data-from-variables) in a [message node](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/message-nodes1/message-nodes) to display that response to the end user.

For example, if you receive the following response, you can use this syntax ``` {{{variables.variablename.data.0.Owner.name}}}  ``` to display only the account owner's name.

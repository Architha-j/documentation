### 1.2 Configure webhook URL in Kapture CRM Dashboard

To receive events, you need to configure the webhook URL in the **Kapture CRM Dashboard**. 

Copy the webhook url and the api key mentioned in the **Instructions** section of the **Kapture CRM Integration** Card. Append the region of your bot to the domain of the webhook url. r1/r2/r3/r4/r5 are the regions of your bot, you can refer the following list for the same.

* r1 = MEA
* r2 = Jakarta
* r4= USA
* r5 = Europe
* r3 = Singapore


For example, if the domain is https://cloud.yellow.ai, you need to change it to https://r1.cloud.yellow.ai if the region of the bot is r1. If the bot belongs to India, you can use origin domain itself.

This integration lets you connect with live agents on the **Kapture CRM** platform from your yellow.ai account.

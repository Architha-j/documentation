## Recieve Atlassian events in your bot

1. Go to **Studio** > **Event** > **Custom events** and create a custom event named ```atlassian-auth-success```. Click [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/events/event-hub#custom-events) for the steps to create custom event.

2. You can set this event as a [start trigger for a flow](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/Flows/configureflow#13-trigger-flow-using-event). This flow will get triggered after a user has successfully been authorized. [Build the flow](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/Flows/journeys) to execute the desired action immediately after the user's authorization.

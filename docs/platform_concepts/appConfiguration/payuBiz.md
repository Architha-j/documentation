Integrate your Yellow.ai platform with [PayU ](https://payu.in/about-us?_ga=2.219146714.274874686.1677657469-282964387.1677657469)account to receive payments from your users through PayU. You can generate payment links, UPI intents for whatsapp pay and receive notifications on the success/failure of the payments.

## 1. Connect PayU with Yellow.ai

To connect your PayU account with yellow.ai, follow these steps:

### 1.1 Get API keys for your PayU account

You need to write to [PayUBiz team](mailto:integration@payu.in) for the API keys. They will provide the keys for both the modes.

1. **Test Mode:** The test mode is a simulation mode that you can use to test your integration flow. Your customers will not be able to make payments in this mode.
2. **Live Mode:** Once you have tested your integration, you can switch to the live mode by replacing the test mode keys(in the yellow.ai integration section) with the live mode keys to accept payments from customers.

Enter the API keys in the **Client ID** field of Yellow.ai's integration module, which we will cover in the following section.

### 1.2 Enable the integration in yellow.ai 

1. Login to cloud.yellow.ai and click **Integrations**.

2. Look for **PayU Business** in the search box or choose the **Payment** category and click **PayU Business**.

3. Fill in the following fields:

* **Salt value:** Salt Value is used to create a unique hash for each transaction, which is then used to verify the authenticity of the transaction. The Salt Value is provided by PayU and should be kept confidential.
* **Client ID:** Enter the **API** keys here.
* **Payu base URL:** Payubase URL is used to send API requests to the PayU payment gateway for payment processing.
* **Payu UPI base URL:** Payu UPI base URL is used to send API requests to the PayU UPI payment gateway for UPI payment processing.

Payu base URL and and Payu UPI base URL will differ for test and live modes.

**Payubase URL** 

* Test mode - https://test.payu.in
* Live mode - https://info.payu.in

**Payu UPI Base URL**

* Test mode - https://test.payu.in
* Live mode - https://secure.payu.in

4. Click **Connect** when you're done.
5. If you have multiple accounts, follow the above mentioned steps to add each of them.

:::note
1. Enter a unique name for each account to easily identify them within the yellow.ai platform. It is recommended to use a name that aligns with its purpose for better usability. 
2. You can add a maximum of 15 merchant accounts.
3. In a two-tier environment, such as bots with only Development/Live environments, you can add account names only in the development mode. Once added and flows have been built, in the Live mode, you can only choose the account names and not edit them.
4. In a three-tier environment, such as bots with Staging/Sandbox/Production modes, in Staging and Sandbox modes, you can add and edit new accounts. However, in Production, only the account details added in Staging will be available. You can only map in the production environment.

### 1.3 Configure webhook url 

Copy the webhook URL and the API key mentioned in the **Instructions** section of the PayUBiz Integration section in the yellow.ai platform.

         "message": null,
         "referenceId": "af65159e8566652849bc12a3450a8fca",
         "statusCode": null,
         "txnId": "wa5iy6b82pvquxcd1vby",
         "txnStatus": "pending",
         "unmappedStatus": "pending"

Yellow.ai Integration with Instamojo Payment Gateway allows your bot to effortlessly generate payment links, monitor payment statuses, and facilitate refunds directly within the Yellow.ai platform. 

## Connecting Instamojo with Yellow.ai

Follow these steps to begin integrating:

### 1. Get required details from your Instamojo account


1. Sign up on Instamojo.
    * __Test Mode:__ This mode is intended for testing purposes and for developers who are just beginning their integration with Instamojo. Test Mode is completely free of charge but requires completion of KYC (Know Your Customer) verification. No actual charges will be incurred, even if valid card details are provided on the [Instamojo test environment](https://test.instamojo.com/) for sign-up.
    * __Live mode__: In Live Mode, transactions occur in real-time, and actual charges apply. To operate in Live Mode, users must provide their bank account information and complete the KYC (Know Your Customer) process. This ensures compliance with regulatory requirements and enables seamless processing of payments. To get started with Live Mode, visit [Instamojo's website](https://www.instamojo.com/) and sign up for an account.

2. After signing up, log in to the Instamojo account and go to **Dashboard** > Go to** API & Plugins** > **Generate Credentials** > Select **Direct Rest API Integration**.

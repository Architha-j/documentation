5. If you have multiple accounts, follow the above mentioned steps to add each of them.

:::note
1. Enter a unique name for each account to easily identify them within the yellow.ai platform. It is recommended to use a name that aligns with its purpose for better usability. 
2. You can add a maximum of 5 merchant accounts.
3. In a two-tier environment, such as bots with only Development/Live environments, you can add account names only in the development mode. Once added and flows have been built, in the Live mode, you can only choose the account names and not edit them.
4. In a three-tier environment, such as bots with Staging/Sandbox/Production modes, in Staging and Sandbox modes, you can add and edit new accounts. However, in Production, only the account details added in Staging will be available. You can only map in the production environment.

### 1.2 Configure webhook URL in Avaya Dashboard

To receive events, you need to configure the webhook URL in the **Avaya Dashboard**. 

Copy the webhook url and the api key mentioned in the **Instructions** section of the **Avaya Integration** Card. Append the region of your bot to the domain of the webhook url. r1/r2/r3/r4/r5 are the regions of your bot, you can refer the following list for the same.

* r1 = MEA
* r2 = Jakarta
* r4= USA
* r5 = Europe
* r3 = Singapore


For example, if the domain is https://cloud.yellow.ai, you need to change it to https://r1.cloud.yellow.ai if the region of the bot is r1. If the bot belongs to India, you can use origin domain itself.

 ## 2. Use-case

This integration lets you connect with live agents on the **Avaya** platform from your yellow.ai account. 

:::note
When multiple accounts are added, select the appropriate account for each node, allowing you to leverage the unique functionalities of each account for their intended purposes.

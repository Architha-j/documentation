You can integrate the Yellow.ai platform with your [Razorpay ](https://razorpay.com/)account to receive payments from your end users. Along with receiving payments, you can also perform the following actions:

* Generate a payment link and receive the status (success/failure) of the payment.
* Generate a payment link to receive partial payments and receive the status (success/failure) of the payments.
* Initiate refund process.
* Check refund status. 

## 1. Connect Razorpay with Yellow.ai

Connect your Yellow.ai platform with your Razorpay account by following the below-mentioned steps.

### 1.1 Generate API keys on Razorpay dashboard

1. Log into your **Razorpay** account and select the mode (Test/Live) for which you want to generate the API key.

* **Test Mode:** The test mode is a simulation mode in which you can test your integration flow. Your customers cannot make payments in this mode. Check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwiv6zSVVCM) to know more.
* **Live Mode:** When your integration is complete, switch to **Live** mode and generate live mode API keys. Replace test mode keys with live mode keys in the integration to accept payments from customers.Check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30REpNtYSak) to know more.

**To generate API keys for a  mode**,

 Navigate to **Settings** > **API Keys** > **Generate Key** to generate key for the selected mode.

The **Key Id** and **Key Secret** will appear on the following page. Downalod them to use in your Yellow.ai platform.

### 1.2 Enable the Integration in Yellow.ai's Integrations Module.


1. Login to [cloud.yellow.ai](https://cloud.yellow.ai/auth/login), go to the **Overview Switcher** and click **Integrations**.

3. Look for **Razorpay** in the search box or click the **Payment** category on the left navigation bar and then click **Razorpay**.

 ![](https://i.imgur.com/TMzGetO.png)

5. Click **+ Add account** and fill in the fields. Click **Connect** when you're done.
6. If you have multiple accounts, follow the above mentioned steps to add each of them.

:::note
1. Enter a unique name for each account to easily identify them within the yellow.ai platform. It is recommended to use a name that aligns with its purpose for better usability. 
2. You can add a maximum of 15 merchant accounts.
3. In a two-tier environment, such as bots with only Development/Live environments, you can add account names only in the development mode. Once added and flows have been built, in the Live mode, you can only choose the account names and not edit them.
4. In a three-tier environment, such as bots with Staging/Sandbox/Production modes, in Staging and Sandbox modes, you can add and edit new accounts. However, in Production, only the account details added in Staging will be available. You can only map in the production environment.
:::
 
### 1.3 Configure webhook URL in Razorpay Dashboard 

To receive events, you need to configure the webhook URL in the **Razorpay Dashboard**.

Copy the webhook url and the api key mentioned in the **Instructions** section of the Razorpay Integration Card. Append the region of your bot to the domain of the webhook url. r1/r2/r3/r4/r5 are the regions of your bot, you can refer the following list for the same.

r1 = MEA
r2 = Jakarta
r4= USA
r5 = Europe
r3 = Singapore

For example, if the domain is https://cloud.yellow.ai, you need to change it to https://r1.cloud.yellow.ai if the region of the bot is MEA. If the bot belongs to India, you can use origin domain itself.

### 1.4 Set up webhooks on RazorPay dashboard

1. Log into the [Razorpay Dashboard](https://dashboard.razorpay.com/#/access/signin) and navigate to **Settings** → **Webhooks**.
2. Click **+ Add New Webhook** on the right corner.

 ![](https://i.imgur.com/aE5zgwH.png)

3. In the **Webhook Setup** pop-up, enter the URL in which you'd like to receive the webhook payload when an event is triggered. We recommend using a **HTTPS URL**. Ensure you enable all the events shown in the screenshot below.

 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Zfsj8ub.png" alt="drawing" width="80%"/>

:::note
You can set upto 10 URLs to receive Webhook notifications. Webhooks can only be delivered to public URLs. If you attempt to save a localhost endpoint as part of a webhook setup, you will encounter an error.
:::

4. Enter a **Secret** for the webhook endpoint. This secret will be used to validate whether the webhook is from **RazorPay**. Do not expose this secret publicly. Click [here](https://razorpay.com/docs/webhooks/validate-test/) to know more validating webhooks. 
5. In the **Alert Email** field, enter the email address to which the notifications should be sent in case there's a webhook failure.
6. Select the required events from the list of **Active Events**.
7. Click **Create Webhook**. After you set a webhook, it appears on the list of webhooks.

:::note
To modify the webhook further, you can select the webhook and click **Edit**. You can refer this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qojkh8Vbnek) as well.
:::

### 1.5 Receive events in Yellow.ai

1. Login to cloud.yellow.ai and click **Studio**. 
2. Click **Event** from the left navigation bar and then choose **Integrations**.
3. Activate the event **Razorpay Payment Status** by clicking the three dots next to it.

 ![](https://i.imgur.com/fK1Eoii.png)

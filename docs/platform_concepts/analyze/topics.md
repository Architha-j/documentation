In customer service automation, understanding and leveraging conversation data is pivotal. One of the most powerful tools at your disposal is the analysis of topics automatically generated by your AI-agent. This analysis helps identify opportunities to improve your automated resolution rate, leading to a more efficient and satisfying customer experience.

When your AI-agent generates topics, it categorizes conversations based on the themes discussed. These topics are crucial for identifying areas where your AI-agent can improve its performance. The default sorting of topics by **Contained Resolution (CR)** opportunity highlights the most significant opportunities for enhancing your AI-agent's automated resolution rate.

To access topics page:
1. Log in to the yellow.ai platform. 
2. Open **Analyse > Conversation logs**. 
3. Navigate to **Topics**.

## Key metrics for topic analysis

### Article suggestion 

Based on the conversations AI has processed, articles are suggested for each topic with Article suggestion icon highlighted. These suggestions can serve as new additions to the existing knowledge base.

### Automation Opportunity

Automation Opportunity opportunity metric represents the total opportunity a topic has to improve your overall automated resolution rate. It is calculated as:

> **Automation Opportunity** = Unresolved conversations under a topic/Unresolved conversations across all topics

This helps identify which topics have the most potential for improvement.


### Conversation share

This metric shows the proportion of conversations involving a particular topic compared to all conversations:
> **Conversation Share** = Conversations under a topic/Conversations across all topics

It helps prioritize topics based on their frequency.

For example, in the below screenshot, Out of 809 conversations taken place in this AI-agent, 29 belong to this topic.

### AI resolution rate

The AI resolution rate indicates the percentage of conversations on a topic that were successfully resolved by the AI-agent without human intervention:

> **AI resolution rate** = Conversations in this topic that were contained AND resolved/Conversations in this topic

A higher AI resolution rate signifies better AI-agent performance in resolving issues autonomously.

### Automation rate

This metric measures the percentage of conversations on a topic that were not escalated to a human agent:

> **Automation Rate** = Conversations in this topic not handed over to a human agent/Conversations in this topic

A higher Automation rate indicates greater efficiency in handling the topic without needing human support.

### User sentiment

This metric assesses the sentiment of users during conversations about a specific topic. It shows the percentage of positive, negative and neutral conversations that have taken place while discussing about this topic. Understanding user sentiment helps in identifying areas where the AI-agent's responses might need improvement to enhance customer satisfaction.

<!--
For example, in the below screenshot, out of 1045 conversations in this topic, 550 (52.6%) were positive, 364 (34.8%) were negative, and 131 (12.5%) were neutral.

## Utilize topics for AI-agent improvement

By closely monitoring these metrics, you can gain actionable insights into your AI-agent's performance and identify areas for enhancement. Here are some steps to leverage topic analysis effectively:

- **Prioritize high-opportunity topics**: Focus on topics with high CR Opportunity to make the most significant impact on your automated resolution rate. These are the areas where improving the AI-agent's responses can yield the highest returns.
- **Analyze low containment rate topics**: Investigate topics with low containment rates to understand why users are being escalated to human agents. This can help in refining the AI-agent's responses or providing better training data.
- **Enhance CR Rate**: For topics with lower CR Rates, consider revising the AI-agent’s dialogue scripts, adding more detailed FAQs, or improving the AI-agent’s understanding through advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
- **Monitor sentiment**: Keep an eye on user sentiment for each topic. If users consistently express negative sentiments, it’s a signal that the AI-agent’s handling of that topic needs improvement.

Conversations with fewer than three messages are not analyzed, as there isn't enough context to form a meaningful interaction.

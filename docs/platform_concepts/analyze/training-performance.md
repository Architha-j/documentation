Message view refers to how well the AI-agent has been trained to understand and respond to user input in a conversational context. It is typically evaluated by testing the AI-agent's ability to generate accurate and relevant responses to a set of input that it has not seen before. 

To access this option, go to **Analyze** > **Message view**.

* **Date**

 Utterances that fall under this date range will be displayed. 

* **Confidence range**

 Confidence range is the % value based on the accuracy of the predicted Intent. Confidence score lies between 0 and 1. If the **Confidence Range** is 1, all the messages would be displayed, if it is .85, only the unidentified utterances would be displayed.

* **Small talk**

 [Small talk](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/train/smalltalk) responds to casual conversations with the users. Enable **Hide out of domain** to avoid displaying messages that doesn't mean anything.

 Once you have set the filters, click the **Apply filter** button at the bottom to apply the changes. To reset these filters, click the **Reset filters** button.

## Freemium plan limitations

While the Freemium plan provides businesses with a cost-effective way to access Yellow.ai's conversational AI solutions, it does come with certain limitations.

## Other pricing 

### Monthly reached users (MRU) pricing

Yellow.ai charges businesses based on the MRU count. With MRU pricing, you are billed according to the number of MRUs, ensuring that you pay only for the value you receive. Each user is counted once per month, regardless of the number of campaigns they engage with. This transparent pricing model allows you to optimize costs and align your expenses with the actual value delivered by Yellow.ai.

### WhatsApp pricing

Meta has announced updates to its price policy starting June 1, 2023. Yellow.ai charges businesses based on the MRU count. The charges for WhatsApp conversations are determined by the end user's phone number, and the cost varies depending on the type of conversation, country, or location. Users can have up to 1,000 free conversations every month. If the limit is exceeded, a monthly fee will apply.

To see your account activity:

**Common use case:**       
In the Inbox module, agents can handle customer queries and respond through either the mobile app or a signed-in device. In such situations, there may be two active sessions running simultaneously, one on the laptop and another on the mobile app. To keep track of all the active sessions of an agent, the platform provides a session tracking feature. This feature allows you to monitor details such as the operating system used, the browser being utilized, and the respective date and time for each session.

## Step 2: Create or Access your AI agent

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a AI agent on the Yellow.ai platform. The process differs slightly depending on whether you are a **Super Admin** (who originally creates the bot) or a **Contributor** (who accesses the bot after it has been created).

### Creating a AI agent (For Super Admin)

1. Go to the **Overview** page.

2. Click on the AI agent icon at the bottom of the page and select **+ Create AI agent**.

5. Select the subscription under which the AI agent should be created.

6. Choose the appropriate **Data storage region** where your agent’s data will be hosted and click **Next**.

7. In the **+ Create AI agent** page, provide the following details:
     - **Name**: Enter a unique name for your AI agent.
     - **Choose avatar**: Select an animated avatar to visually represent your AI agent.
     - **Select a persona**: This defines the agent’s tone and communication style. You can select from the following personas:
       * **Polite and persuasive**: Ideal for sales agents.
       * **Empathetic and helpful**: Best suited for support agents.
       * **Witty**: Best for marketing agents.
     - **Role**: Describe the role of the AI agent in less than 400 characters. For example, you are a banking assistant who helps users with Yellow Banking-related queries. Your role is focused on assisting with personal loans-guiding users to apply loan, checking loan status, and answering loan specific questions for better accuracy and support.

8. Click **Next**.   

9. Provide either your website URL or upload documents. This content will be used to train the AI agent.

* After adding the knowledge source, your AI agent will be created and ready for further configuration.

### Requesting Access for Your Org’s AI agent (For non-super admin)

For other org users, when you log in, you will see a list of bots that have been created. You can:
  - Request access to a AI agent, or
  - Navigate to **Profile settings > My Invites** page and click on the respective **Request access** button.

### Accepting Access for Your Org’s AI agent (For Non-Super Admin)
You can accept the invite using either of the two ways:

1. If a AI agent admin has already provided access, you can accept the invitation received via email.

2. You can also accept through the notification you received on the platform's **Notifications** page.

## Accessing Existing Bot (For other users)

If you are a **Contributor** or a user with access rights (but not the original creator), your process of interacting with bots is different:

### Accessing the AI agent

1. Navigate to **Profile settings > My Invites**. Instead of creating a new AI agent, you will see a list of AI agents that your admin/team has already created.

2. Click on the respective **Request Access** button to request access to the AI agent.

:::note
Only **Super Admin** can create a new AI agent. Other users can request access to a AI agent and may have Admin roles, but they do not have the privilege to create a AI agent.

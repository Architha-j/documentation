## Step 1: Start in development environment

Yellow.ai provides separate environments to help you build, test, and safely deploy AI agents. You can build your AI agent only in lower environments. Once everything’s ready, publish to Live or Production. This ensures that only stable, approved updates reach your end users.

Depending on your subscription plan, you may see two or three environments. 

* **Freemium** plan contains Development and Live environments
* **Premium** plan contains Sandbox, Staging, and Production environments.

Use the environment switcher in the top-right corner to move between stages.

## Step 2: Create or access your AI agent

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a AI agent on the Yellow.ai platform. The process differs slightly depending on whether you are a **Super Admin** (who originally creates the AI agent) or a **Contributor** (who accesses the AI agent after it has been created).

### Creating an AI agent (For Super Admin)

1. Go to the **Overview** page.

2. Click on the AI agent icon at the bottom of the page and select **+ Create AI agent**.

5. Select the subscription under which the AI agent should be created.

6. Choose the appropriate **Data storage region** where your agent’s data will be hosted and click **Next**.

7. In the **+ Create AI agent** page, provide the following details:
     - **Name**: Enter a unique name for your AI agent.
     - **Choose avatar**: Select an animated avatar to visually represent your AI agent.
     - **Select a persona**: This defines the agent’s tone and communication style. You can select from the following personas:
       * **Polite and persuasive**: Ideal for sales agents.
       * **Empathetic and helpful**: Best suited for support agents.
       * **Witty**: Best for marketing agents.
     - **Role**: Describe the role of the AI agent in less than 400 characters. For example, you are a banking assistant who helps users with Yellow Banking-related queries. Your role is focused on assisting with personal loans-guiding users to apply loan, checking loan status, and answering loan specific questions for better accuracy and support.

8. Click **Next**.   

9. Provide either your website URL or upload documents. This content will be used to train the AI agent.

* After adding the knowledge source, your AI agent will be created and ready for further configuration.

### Requesting Access for Your Org’s AI agent (For non-super admin)

For other org users, when you log in, you will see a list of AI agents that have been created. You can:
  - Request access to a AI agent, or
  - Navigate to **Profile settings > My Invites** page and click on the respective **Request access** button.

### Accepting Access for your org’s AI agent (For Non-Super Admin)
You can accept the invite using either of the two ways:

1. If a AI agent admin has already provided access, you can accept the invitation received via email.

2. You can also accept through the notification you received on the platform's **Notifications** page.

## Accessing existing AI agent (For other users)

If you are a **Contributor** or a user with access rights (but not the original creator), your process of interacting with AI agents is different:

### Accessing the AI agent

1. Navigate to **Profile settings > My Invites**. Instead of creating a new AI agent, you will see a list of AI agents that your admin/team has already created.

2. Click on the respective **Request Access** button to request access to the AI agent.

Only **Super Admin** can create a new AI agent. Other users can request access to a AI agent and may have Admin roles, but they do not have the privilege to create a AI agent.

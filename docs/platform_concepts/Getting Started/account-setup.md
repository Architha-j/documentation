## Log out of yellow.ai

The platform has an automatic logout feature that activates after a few minutes of inactivity. If you are inactive for a certain period, the platform will log you out for security purposes. To continue using the platform, you will need to sign in again.

If you wish to log out of the platform voluntarily, you can do so by clicking on **Logout** under the User account section.

:::info
Inbox agents who handle customer tickets are not automatically logged out after a period of inactivity. This is because they may be actively waiting for incoming tickets from other users, and automatic logout could disrupt their ability to respond promptly to customer queries.

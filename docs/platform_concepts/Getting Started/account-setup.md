## Freemium plan overview

Yellow.ai offers a **Freemium plan**. The plan is designed for new users and serves as a trial version for a limited period. It allows you to explore the product and its capabilities at no cost. During this trial, you can test the platform's features and functionalities to see how well it fits your business needs. With the Freemium plan, you can experience the full potential of our platform and its essential features before committing to premium plans.



The Freemium plan includes the following features:

1. Analyze bot performance by reviewing deflection rates with 5,000 monthly bot conversations.
2. Add QnAs to the [FAQ](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/train/add-faqs) module to effectively deflect tickets.
3. Have unlimited [agents](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/inbox_setup/supportagents) to answer customer questions. 
4. Handle up to 500 chat and email tickets per month by transferring chats to an agent.
5. Increase your agents' productivity with features like canned responses, and integrate two channels (website, WhatsApp, mobile app) for customer interactions, along with a unified inbox for your agents.

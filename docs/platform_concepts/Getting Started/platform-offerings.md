## 3. Set up your bot 

Before creating a bot, you must have a clear idea of what you are desiging. Get all your initial questions ready for all the use cases that you want to solve using the bot.


We have made your life easy by creating bots. There are readily available templates in our **Marketplace** that have a lot of flows based on real-time use cases. You will also see recommendations specific to your industry that you can just plug-and-play and start running your bot.

However, there could be some use cases that are not available in our Marketplace. You can use [Studio](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/overview) to completely build your bot from scratch.

You can also use the readily available templates if they are suitable for your use case.

The platform also includes different environments, giving you complete freedom to experiment with the various options and then push the final version to the live bot with Environment. These are the different environments supported:

## 4. Modify bot details

You will provide basic details about the bot when signing up. However, you have the flexibility to modify the bot information whenever required using **Configure**.  

However, this does not impact the functionality of the bot that you have created.

## 5. Add collaborators

You can involve other members of the team or cross team members to build the bot. With Yellow.ai, you can share bot access with other members, and define their roles. All the invited members can contribute to building a better bot based on the business use case.

:::note
Only superadmin can share bots and revoke access.

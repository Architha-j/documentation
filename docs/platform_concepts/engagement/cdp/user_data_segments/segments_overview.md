A user segment is a grouping of users based on common characteristics. There are two type of segments - Static segment and dynamic segment. You can use static and dynamic segments to effectively tailor your communication to different user groups and improve the overall user experience.

* **Static segments**: These segments are manually created by uploading a specific set of users. For instance, you can upload users who have shown interest in a product, visited your pricing page, trial users or belong to a specific department. You can [create static segments when uploading users via a CSV file](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/user_data_segments/segment-csv).
* **Dynamic segments**: These segments are generated based on conditions defined using [user properties](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/user_data_segments/segment-properties) or [events](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/user_data_segments/segments-events). For instance, you can create segments with users who purchased in the last 30 days, age is between 20-30 and so on. As these are dynamic, the  user count in a segment changes over time. 


Here are some user segmentation examples based on different specializations:

**E-commerce**:

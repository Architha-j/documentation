:::note
* You can also use this process to delete an individual user. 
* Known issue:
   * When you select all entries and click **Delete**, it will delete the users displayed on the first page only. Users on subsequent pages will not be affected.

### Delete all user records

Currently, thereâ€™s no direct way to delete all user records at once, as this option is restricted due to feature gating. 

To enable the **Delete all users** option temporarily for three days, you need to submit a request to the platform team via DevRev. Once enabled, you will find the option under the **Actions** drop-down.

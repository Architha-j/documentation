The following are the key actions that you can perform on user 360.

### Create user records

The platform provides different ways to add your users. You can add each user manually or leverage advanced features  to quickly create your user base and maintain it real-time.  
* Add bulk users [through CSV import](/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/user_data/import_users) 
* Use our [REST APIs](/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/enriching_user_profiles/send_user_data_event_rest_api) to add or modify users real-time.
* Use [Bot Builder to create and update users](/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/user_data/data_capture_convers)


### Enrich user data

It is important to collect data that is specific to your users. While there are some predefined properties, called [System Properties](/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/user_data/user_properties#system-user-properties), you can also create and send [Custom properties](/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/user_data/user_properties#custom-user-properties) and Events.

 
User properties store data about who your users are, events tell you when users take important actions on your product.


### Create segments to power personalisation

 

By combining the user data with Properties and Events, you can [create highly focussed segments](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/user_data_segments/creating_managing_user_segment). These segments update automatically as and when users match the criteria that you set.


You can group your users based on certain characteristics such as who they are and what they do. 




## User events

User events refer to specific actions or activities a user performs within a system, app, or platform. These define user behavior, engagements, and interactions. 
The standard events include user creation, user update, and user deletion. 

You can also create [custom events](/docs/platform_concepts/studio/events/event-hub#-8-custom-events) to capture important activities or conversations and [send events data](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/17583548/UVsEVUsg#00eb59cf-7f00-461e-8d53-94eafb056a9a) to yellow.ai. Custom events can include activities such as clicks, page views, form submissions, purchases, logins, searches, interactions with specific features, and more. Tracking user events help businesses gain valuable insights into user engagement, preferences, patterns, and conversion behavior.


In User 360, you can view and filter events based on specific criteria. For example:
- Users who have frequently visited the same product page recently
- Users who have used the export feature multiple times
- Users who have downgraded their plan


## Export your user data

 If you want to update your user base or use it outside Yellow.ai,  you to export user data easily and use it wherever required. To know more, see [Export users data](/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/user_data_segments/manage_user_data).

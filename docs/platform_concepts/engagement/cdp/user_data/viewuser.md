User 360 lets you view the complete details of a user including user properties, tags, user events, and segments. You can use the Filter option to fetch users based on a certain condition, especially when the user base is large.

## Organize & customise User 360 table

You can organize user properties to better understand your data. You can also customize the table by choosing the fields you want to see and ordering them as you prefer. For instance, you can place user identifier on the first column.


To customise the User 360 table:

1. On the **User 360** page, click **User properties**.

3. In **Arrange your properties** (right pane), drag a property to the required position.

4. Click **Save**. This action will save your preference and reloads the table to display your new preference.

## Filter users

To see details of an existing user, follow these steps:

1. On the User 360 home page, navigate to the user whose details you want to see.

2. If the user list is long, use **Filters** to show a specific set of records from the entire user base.
3. In **Conditions**, define the condition by which you want to filter users.

You can see three boxes that correspond to {parameter}{operator}{value}.

* **Parameter**: The user property that you want to use to filter records (first box).
* **Operator**: The condition that you want to define. It contains `Is known`, `Is not known`, `Is`, `Isn't`, `Contains`, and `Does not contain`. These values might differ based on the parameter selected.
* **Value**: The value of the expression. This might not apply to all operators. For example, firstName Is Tom, phone is known, and emailOptin is true.
3. Use **+** to evaluate `or` conditions. For example, the condition `firstname is tom` + `sam` fetches users whose first name is either Tom or Sam.

4. Use **+ Add condition** to evaluate multiple conditions (`and`). For example, the condition `gender is Male` and `phoneNumber is known` fetches all male users whose phone number is available in User 360, `emailOptIn is false` fetches all users who have opted out from emails.

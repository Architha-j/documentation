## Add user
This is best for adding one user at a time, like prospects you met at an event, or a lead who reached out on LinkedIn.

To add a user using the User 360 UI:

1. On the **User 360** module, click **Add user** > **Single user**.

3. Label the user with **Tags**. You can add multiple tags to a user. 

3.  Click **Save**. 

***

## Edit user

You can add missing properties or update existing properties of a user. As the `userId` is the primary identifier and unique for a user, you cannot change it.


1. On the **User 360** page, navigate to the user that you want to edit and click on the user row.

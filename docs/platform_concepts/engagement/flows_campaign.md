Yellow.ai's Flow campaign is a conversational marketing tool with an advanced campaign building tool. It helps marketers deliver a comprehensive customer experience across different channels and engage customers at every stage of their journey. 


A Flow campaign consists of user journeys which you can utilise to strategically target customers across various channels. You can quickly develop flows using the no-code builder in accordance to your business needs. This also allows tracking customer activities across platforms, and you can further analyse the data to make decisions. 

  
#### Use case

This sample use case shows how to effectively engage users by nudging them at different stages in a flow using the Flow campaign.

Consider a cart abandonment example in an e-commerce store.

1. Send a reminder message through a Push notification to proceed with the purchase after one day.
2. For users who have read the push notification, send an exclusive 10% off coupon on WhatsApp.
3. If the user has not responded to the message, resend the coupon over WhatsApp after 48 hours.
4. Wait a couple more days and end the flow.
 
 
The campaign flow builder consists of five categories of nodes:

* Entry point
* Condition
* Flow control
* Message 
* Action

See how to configure each node in the following sections.

***

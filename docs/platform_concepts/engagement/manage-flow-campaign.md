## Archive a flow campaign

You can easily archive campaigns that are no longer active or relevant. Archiving allows you to keep your campaigns organized by removing unnecessary campaigns, while still retaining access to important data and analytics. 

::note
You can archive campaigns in **Draft** and **Completed** status, but not Live or Scheduled campaigns.

To archive a campaign:
1. On the Flows page, navigate to the desired flow you wish to archive.
2. Click on the More options icon > **Archive**.

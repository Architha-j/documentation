Flow templates offer a convenient method for exporting and reusing existing flows when building future bots. By exporting flow templates, you can easily replicate successful bot configurations and tailor them to different use cases or customize them based on specific requirements in very less time.

Exported flow templates will be accessible in **Marketplace**'s **Access** section, where they can be used as pre-built templates for creating new bots. 

:::note
- Export flow will work only for bots created after Oct 2021.
- Export flow will work for all the bots irrespective of region. While cloning flows to another bot, source and destination has to be of the same region.

### How to configure dynamic video

You can use Video node to display dynamic videos (which keeps changing) based on a userâ€™s selection. For instance, when a user requests a tutorial for a specific topic, the AI-agent fetches and displays the relevant video tutorial.

To display a dynamic video, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Functions** and add the code to dynamically fetch the video.

**Dynamic format**

```c
const videoVar = {
  "url": "http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4",
  "caption": { 
    "type": "text",
    "value": "video caption"
  }
}
```
or 

```
const videoVar = "http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4"
```

2. Add a Function node to the flow editor.

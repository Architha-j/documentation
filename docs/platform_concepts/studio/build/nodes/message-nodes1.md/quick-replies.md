Display a question along with quick reply buttons with this node. For example, the AI-agent prompts the user with options like Technical Issue, Billing Inquiry, etc., enabling quick selection of the relevant category for their product-related query.

> Unlike the Quick Replies Prompt node, a fallback message need not be configured to this nor this node is expected to follow another node.

The **Raise a Ticket** node allows your AI agent to create a support ticket when a user's query requires human assistance or follow-up. It acts as a seamless bridge between the AI conversation and your support system.

If your team uses Yellow.ai's in-house support system, tickets will be raised in **Yellow.ai Inbox**. If you use a different live chat or support platform, you can integrate with Yellow.ai to raise and manage tickets directly in that system. 
[Here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/appConfiguration/overview#6-live-chat) is the list of third-party live chat integrations supported.

#### Error handling

The output of a Raise Ticket Node dictates general behaviour for any error in creating a ticket. In most real life scenarios, it is preferred to show appropriate reasons to users as to why they cannot to an agent. 

:::note
Once any specific event is active and configured, the corresponding flow will be given preference. AI-agent is never paused unless a ticket is in ASSIGNED state (i.e. Agent is interacting with the user).
:::

Two steps to handle custom scenarios are as follows:
1. In [Events](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/events/event-hub), activate the custom inbox event. Scenarios that can be handled:
  - All Available Agents Busy
  - All Available Agents Away
  - All Available Agents Offline
  - All Available Agents Limit Reached
  - Queue Not Enabled
  - Group Queue Not Enabled
  - Group Queue Limit Reached
  - Offline Ticketing Not Enabled
  - Offline Ticketing Not Enabled for Groups
  - Offline Ticket Queue Limit Reached

2.[ Build a flow with relevant events added in the Start Trigger](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/Flows/configureflow#trigger-flow-using-event).

#### Working hours

If the AI-agent is supposed to respond with a different message outside of agent working hours, [Logic Node](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/logic-nodes) can be used.

:::note
The AI-agent default timezone is considered while evaluating whether a user is outside working hours.
:::

#### Auto-translate incoming chats

Inbox supports automatic translation, allowing agents to assist customers without requiring knowledge of the customer's language. Just enable `Translate User Message` in the raise ticket node configuration to use this feature.

Notification status node is used to monitor and report the delivery status of a notification sent through the system. Notifications may include emails, SMS messages, app alerts, or other forms of communication. The node provides feedback on the outcome of the notification, such as whether the message was successfully delivered, opened, or if it encountered an error during transmission.

You can use the notification, when you want to:
* **Track delivery success**: To know whether an email, SMS, or notification has been delivered to its recipient.
* **Error handling**: Receive immediate feedback if a notification fails to deliver, allowing you to take corrective action.
* **Ensuring user engagement**: To track if the user has interacted with the notification, like reading or responding to it.

**Use case**

* **Email delivery tracking**: Track whether emails sent to users for verification or updates have been successfully delivered, and if they were opened.
* **SMS delivery confirmation**: Ensure that SMS messages, such as OTPs or alerts, have been successfully delivered to a recipientâ€™s phone.
* **Push notification read status**: Track if a user opened or dismissed an app notification, allowing businesses to measure engagement.

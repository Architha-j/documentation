## 1. Difference between FAQ bot and FAQ page

1. **Interactivity**: Chatbots allow users to interact with the information in a conversational manner, rather than just reading through a static page. This makes the experience more engaging and can help users find the information they need more quickly and easily.

2. **Personalization**: Chatbots can provide a personalized experience by asking questions and tailoring the information they provide based on the user's responses. This can help users find the information they need more quickly and efficiently.

3. **Speed**: Chatbots can provide answers to simple questions almost instantly, which can save users time compared to searching through a long FAQ page. 

4. **Analytics**: Chatbots can collect data on user interactions, such as the questions asked and the answers provided, which can help organizations improve their FAQ content over time.

Overall, FAQ chatbots offer a more dynamic, personalized, and efficient way for users to find the information they need compared to traditional FAQ pages.

Small talk adds a friendly touch to conversations with the bot, making interactions feel more natural and engaging. It is particularly useful when users want to chat casually or discuss topics that the bot has not been specifically trained on. 

Since users often prefer shorter sentences and enjoy casual chats, small talk helps bridge the gap between structured queries and relaxed conversation.

Examples of Small talk:

* **Greetings**: "Hello!", "How are you?".
* **General questions**: "What's the weather like?".
* **Personal queries**: "What's your name?", "How old are you?".

You can use the following Small talk for your bot:
1. [Default platform small talk](#default): Generates pre-configured responses to common queries.
2. [Custom configured small talks](#custom): You can create personalized responses tailored to specific needs or preferences.

## Default

The Default section in the Small talk includes pre-existing questions and responses such as "How are you?", "What is your name?", and "Tell me a joke".

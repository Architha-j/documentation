Inputting a website URL into the Knowledge base triggers the creation of a customized bot. This bot is designed to extract and leverage pertinent information from the provided URL, facilitating automated responses and enhancing user engagement.

With Knowledge base, you can achieve: 
- **Efficiency**: Automation reduces manual bot creation efforts and ensures real-time adaptation to website changes.
- **Customization**: Bots are tailored to the unique structure and content of each website, optimizing user engagement.
- **Scalability**: Easily scalable for applications ranging from small business websites to large-scale e-commerce platforms.

This feature, driven by Yellow.ai's exclusive **Studio** module (not GPT), uses a functionality similar to **Document Cognition (Doc Cog)** to support knowledge base responses.

#### KnowledgeBase vs. Doc Cog

The distinction between Doc Cog and the Zero Setup Knowledgebase lies in their response to user queries. While v1.Doc Cog retrieves precise information from its source when a user requests it, the Zero Setup Knowledgebase not only provides the answer to the query but also presents a condensed summary of the information, enhancing the user experience with additional context.



### Use cases

- **Automated website FAQs**:
The Knowledgebase can be utilized to create a bot that automatically responds to FAQs by extracting information directly from the website. This reduces the burden on customer support teams and ensures quick and accurate responses.


- **Product information retrieval**:
Knowledgebase allows the automated bot to retrieve the latest product details, availability, and pricing information directly from the website. This ensures that customers receive accurate and real-time information about the products they are interested in.

- **Dynamic content updates**:
By integrating Knowledgebase, the bot can be configured to pull the most recent content updates from the website. This ensures that users interacting with the bot receive the latest information without manual content management.

- **Interactive learning platforms**:
Knowledgebase can be employed to create a bot that guides learners through specific topics based on the content available on the website. The bot serves as an interactive learning assistant, responding to queries and providing information within the scope of the website's content.

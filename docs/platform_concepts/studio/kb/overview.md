A Knowledge base (KB) is a centralized hub where you can add information to your AI agent, to deliver consistent, accurate, and context-aware responses. It serves as a structured repository for storing and managing information from various sources, including documents, websites, third-party platforms like ServiceNow, and associated metadata. 

You can import content from multiple sources such as sitemaps, URLs, uploaded documents, and ServiceNow to schedule automatic syncs, manage metadata through a dedicated interface, and organize files using folders and subfolders. The system also lets you track the status of each file with ease.

By using existing content from websites, documents, or third-party platforms, your AI agent can efficiently address a wide range of queries, from internal support and customer service to product information and troubleshooting.


#### Key features of Knowledge base

The Knowledge Base module offers:

* **Flexible content ingestion**: Import content from diverse sources such as file uploads, website sitemaps, URLs, or third-party platforms like ServiceNow.
* **Context-rich Metadata configuration**: Apply tags and filters to help the AI agent interpret file context more accurately, enhancing search precision and response relevance.
* **Automated content sync**: Schedule regular syncs to keep your AI agent up to date with the latest information—no manual updates required.
* **Structured file organization**: Organize documents using folders and subfolders by category, department, or topic, ensuring a clean and scalable content structure.

#### Use cases

* **Automated website FAQs**: Automatically extract and respond to frequently asked questions using your website content. Reduce support team workload while delivering fast, accurate answers to users.

* **Product information retrieval**: Provide real-time product details, availability, and pricing by connecting your AI agent to live sources like your website or third-party systems.
* **Dynamic content updates**: Keep your AI agent always up to date by scheduling auto-syncs. This eliminates the need for manual updates and ensures users receive the latest information.
* **Interactive learning platforms**: Use AI agents as learning assistants that guide users through topics by answering their questions and providing real-time information based on your content.

### Create an AI-agent for your website

To create an AI-agent for your website, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Knowledge base** > **Files**.

2. Select the source from which you want to add content (for example, upload documents, enter Sitemaps/URLs, or integrate with ServiceNow). For detailed steps on adding content, click [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/kb/ingestion).


<!-- ## Introduction to knowledge base(KB)

With Knowledge base, effortlessly transform your existing website into an intelligent AI-agent that responds to user queries, requiring zero effort on your part—simply input your website URL, and the AI-agent is ready to engage with precision.

Inputting a website URL into the Knowledge base triggers the creation of a customized AI-agent. This AI-agent is designed to extract and leverage pertinent information from the provided URL, facilitating automated responses and enhancing user engagement.

With Knowledge base, you can achieve: 
- **Efficiency**: Automation reduces manual AI-agent creation efforts and ensures real-time adaptation to website changes.
- **Customization**: AI-agents are tailored to the unique structure and content of each website, optimizing user engagement.
- **Scalability**: Easily scalable for applications ranging from small business websites to large-scale e-commerce platforms.

This feature, driven by Yellow.ai's exclusive **Automation** module (not GPT), uses a functionality similar to **Document Cognition (Doc Cog)** to support knowledge base responses.

#### KnowledgeBase vs. Doc Cog

The distinction between Doc Cog and the Zero Setup Knowledgebase lies in their response to user queries. While v1.Doc Cog retrieves precise information from its source when a user requests it, the Zero Setup Knowledgebase not only provides the answer to the query but also presents a condensed summary of the information, enhancing the user experience with additional context.



### Use cases

- **Automated website FAQs**:
The Knowledgebase can be utilized to create a AI-agent that automatically responds to FAQs by extracting information directly from the website. This reduces the burden on customer support teams and ensures quick and accurate responses.


- **Product information retrieval**:
Knowledgebase allows the automated AI-agent to retrieve the latest product details, availability, and pricing information directly from the website. This ensures that customers receive accurate and real-time information about the products they are interested in.

- **Dynamic content updates**:
By integrating Knowledgebase, the AI-agent can be configured to pull the most recent content updates from the website. This ensures that users interacting with the AI-agent receive the latest information without manual content management.

- **Interactive learning platforms**:
Knowledgebase can be employed to create a AI-agent that guides learners through specific topics based on the content available on the website. The AI-agent serves as an interactive learning assistant, responding to queries and providing information within the scope of the website's content.

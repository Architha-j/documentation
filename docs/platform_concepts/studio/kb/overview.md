## Difference between KB and Doc Cog

When a user requests a specific piece of information, **v1.Doc cog**  retrieves only the information from its source, whereas in **Zero Setup**, the bot not only provides the answer to the query but also offers a summarized version of the information.


## Access KB

To access KB:

1. Go to **Studio** > **KB**.

Make sure you enable **Enable summarised results** for the summarisation. To do so, go to **Build** > **Conversation settings** > **Document search**.

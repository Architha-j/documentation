Managing your knowledge base is now simpler and more organized. Previously, all uploaded and synced files were listed together in a single view. With the latest update, you can now use folders and subfolders to group and manage your files more effectively.

📁 What's Changed

* Folder structure support: Users can now create and manage folders and subfolders to organize files by topic, project, or source.
* Improved clarity: The new folder-based view helps you locate, manage, and work with your content more efficiently.


⚙️ How It Works

* During the setup of certain sources like Sitemaps, the system will prompt you to choose a folder. Once setup is complete, all synced files are automatically added to the selected folder—so you don’t have to manually move each file.
* For third-party integrations, folders are created based on the structure provided by the third party. These folders are non-editable and reflect the external system’s organization.
* For all other folders, users can freely move files across folders and subfolders as needed. This gives you full flexibility to reorganize content at any time.

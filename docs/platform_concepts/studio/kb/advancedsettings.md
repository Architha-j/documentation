In addition to its core functionality, our KB offers a range of additional configurations designed to enhance your experience.

## Use KB via. Document search node

Utilize the Document Search node to offer responses from website URLs or documents uploaded on the Knowledgebase (KB) by following these steps:

1. Upload your URL links/Documents to KB.
2. Go to the **Build** section and configure a flow that utilizes doc-cog to generate answers.
    - Employ a Question node to pose a question and store the user query in a variable.
    - Use this variable (user query) as input for the Document Search node.
3. In **Document search settings**, customize the response with the following options:
    - **Number of records to display**
    - **Max no. of results per document**
    - **When results found**:  Enter text to be displayed when the Document search/KB node generates a response successfully 
    - **When result not found**: Enter text to be displayed when the Document search/KB node does not respond

## Add acronyms 


You can boost bot understanding and search accuracy via Acronyms.

In the **Acronym** section, you can enter common phrases for specific terms. This helps the bot understand and fetch accurate results from the documentation, even when users use abbreviations. For example, users might use **WA** for **WhatsApp**. If you add this acronym the bot can understand it as **WhatsApp** whenever a user uses it. 

To add acronyms, follow:

1. Go to **Studio** > **KB** > **Acronym** > **+ Add new acronyms**.

## Set up a multilingual KB responses 


This feature ensures the KB bot responds in any language, regardless of the language of the website/document. With multi-language support, it searches within the website, retrieves answers, and translates responses into the end user's preferred language, identified either through their language selection or the language in their initial message.

To configure, follow these steps: 

1. Upload your URL links to KB.
2. Navigate to the **Build** section and configure a language setup flow.
    - Add a quick reply node with the **button name** as the language and the **button value** as the ISO code for that language. View the ISO codes [here.](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/localization#1-supported-languages) 
    ![image](https://imgur.com/cMxEl8O.png)
    - Store the response of the Quick reply node in a variable (language).
    - Send the stored variable (language), which is the ISO code, to the Set language node.
    - Follow up with a question/text node to prompt users to ask questions in their preferred language.

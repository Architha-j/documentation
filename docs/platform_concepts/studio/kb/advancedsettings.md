In addition to its core functionality, our KB offers a range of additional configurations designed to enhance your experience. In this document, we'll explore how you can edit both the questions asked by users and the bot responses. We'll also delve into the use of acronyms for improved user question identification and providing accurate answers. Additionally, we'll discuss how to offer multilingual responses to cater to a diverse user base. 

## Boost bot understanding and search accuracy via Acronyms

In the **Acronym** section, you can enter common phrases for specific terms. This helps the bot understand and fetch accurate results from the documentation, even when users use abbreviations. 

For example, users might use **WA** for **WhatsApp**. If you add this acronym the bot can understand it as WhatsApp whenever a user uses it. 

To add an acronym:

1. Go to **Studio** > **KB** > **Acronym** > **+ Add new acronyms**.

2. In **Acronym name** enter the name of the specific term and in **Acronyms** enter the commonly used utterances for that term.

3. Click **Add list item**.

## Edit bot answers

You can edit both the questions posed by end-users and the responses generated by the bot during conversational interactions. This functionality offers enhanced control and customization over the content exchanged between the bot and its users.

1. Go to the **Preview bot** section of KB and test your flow by asking questions. Once the bot replies, click the **Edit** button.

2. In **Your question**, edit the question you asked to test the bot reponses. In **Bot's answer**, edit the response given by the bot and click **Save**.

3. You will be prompted to visit the FAQ page to map more questions to the right answers. Click **Go to FAQ** and refer to this [doc](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/train/add-faqs) to know about the FAQ section in detail.

4. Go back to the **Preview bot** section and test your question and answers.

## Multilingual KB responses

When the knowledge uploaded (documents, integration docs, or website) is in English, we now have the capability to activate multilingual responses within the Knowledge Base (KB). This allows us to translate responses into the end user's preferred language, either based on their language selection or the language identified from their initial message.

Build a flow that gets user's language preference and use [set language node](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/action-nodes#31-set-language) to set the language of the conversation. Then build the rest of the flow with [Doc search node]((https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/action-nodes#14-document-search)) to fetch answers from KB.

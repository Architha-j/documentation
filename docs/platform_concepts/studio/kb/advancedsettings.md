3. In **Knowledge search settings**, customize the response with the following options:
   * Input configuration
   * Knowledge filter
   * AI-agent response configuration

## Set up a multilingual KB responses 


This feature ensures the KB AI-agent responds in any language, regardless of the language of the website/document. With multi-language support, it searches within the website, retrieves answers, and translates responses into the end user's preferred language, identified either through their language selection or the language in their initial message.

To configure, follow these steps: 

1. Upload your URL links to KB.
2. Navigate to the **Build** section and configure a language setup flow.
    - Add a quick reply node with the **button name** as the language and the **button value** as the ISO code for that language. View the ISO codes [here.](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/localization#supported-languages) 
    ![image](https://imgur.com/tgtfXsW.png)
    - Store the response of the Quick reply node in a variable (language).
    - Send the stored variable (language), which is the ISO code, to the Set language node.
    - Follow up with a question/text node to prompt users to ask questions in their preferred language.

We’ve launched a New Knowledge Management module with a focus on control, visibility, and ease of use. This new version solves many of the limitations from the previous setup and introduces powerful new features to improve both internal workflows and customer experiences.

**What’s Improved**

1. Improved Onboarding for Data Sources
Adding a source is now guided and intuitive.
2. Scheduler 
You can now schedule data syncs across for data sources from the UI. 
3. Smarter File and Metadata Management
    * **Bulk actions & filtering**: Save time by making changes across multiple files at once and easily find and manage content using filters, 
    * **Metadata (previously known as tags) management**: Previously, metadata had to be manually entered in the column. Now, users can manage metadata through a, separate interface. 
    * **Change Logs**: Get full visibility into file-level changes and updates.
4. Improved publish experience 
    Removed from Bot Publish: The knowledge base is now independent of the bot publish process, reducing confusion and improving usability.

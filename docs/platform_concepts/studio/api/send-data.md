## <a name="1"></a>1. Send data to API from a bot flow
Once you configure an API as mentioned in [add a new API](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/api/add-api), you can pass all the input parameter values in the bot flow where you want to consume it. These are usually dynamic values that you can capture directly from the user conversation. 
1. To send a dynamic data from a flow, rename the parameters with {{{parameterName}}} for the API in **Studio** > **API** and save it.

3. Open the flow where you wish to send data using the user's input.
4. Add the API actions node in the flow.

6. Add the dynamic parameter fields (such as authentication, email, token, name etc. as per the API).
7. Select a value [transformation function](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/api/transformation-function) in **Parse API response** to extract a part of API response before storing.

8. Test the API to ensure it is working as desired.

9.  Use **Store Response in** to store the response in a variable to access it.

## <a name="2"></a>2. Use base64 URL conversion for files
In cases like uploading an image, video, or any other file formats, you can convert images into a readable string that can be used or transferred anywhere. It is a common practice to upload files through URL through Base64 encoding.

Use the following code inside a body/params -

| Pass URL  | Format |
|-- | --|
Directly | $$tobase64{url}
Through variable | $$tobase64{{{{url}}}

## <a name="3"></a>3. Pass Array/Object variable in JSON

You need to pass the JSON file or the details to be entered as an array/object.

For example, in the below screenshot Details_1 can also be written as Details_2 by storing array details in array_details variable.

Studio is a bot building platform that allows you to easily build and customize bot conversations without requiring coding expertise. It provides all the necessary tools to create and test conversational chatbots effectively.


#### Key features of Studio:

* **Easy conversational flow design**: Easily design the flow of interactions between your bot and customers using intuitive Studio tools like start triggers, [nodes](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes), variables, fallbacks, databases, and functions.
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP) training**: Train your bot with specific intents to trigger the respective flow to respond accurately to user queries.
* **Custom logic implementation**: Implement advanced functionalities such as multilingual communication, API integrations with third-party apps, and database management using custom logic.
* **Conversation logs**: Keep track of the interaction history between users and your bot, allowing you to analyze interactions and identify potential conversation issues.
* **Instant answering bot creation**: Quickly create a bot designed to provide instant answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs). Easily upload offline documents or add website URLs to enrich your bot's knowledge base. With AI-enabled features, it can perform search operations and provide summarized results to user queries.
* **API integration**: Seamlessly integrate third-party APIs that cannot be integrated through the standard integration module. This feature allows you to enhance the functionality of your FAQ bot by accessing external data and services.

### How are AI-agents different from Bots?  

| Feature                            | AI Agents                                                                                   | Bots                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Operational Basis**              | Powered by large language models (LLMs); flexible, not restricted to predefined paths       | Structured, rule-based flows; limited to pre-configured frameworks             |
| **Response Generation**            | Dynamically generates responses based on context, without relying on pre-configured replies | Generates responses based on specific keywords or predefined utterances        |
| **Workflow Automation**            | Can automate tasks dynamically, even when workflows are not explicitly configured           | Executes tasks only within predefined workflows                                |
| **Handling of Unexpected Queries** | Handles complex or unexpected queries by dynamically interpreting and responding            | Limited ability, often requiring escalation for unrecognized inputs            |
| **Adaptability and Flexibility**   | Highly adaptable, adjusts responses and actions based on real-time inputs                   | Limited; follows set paths, may struggle with deviations from the flow         |
| **User Experience**                | Provides seamless experience with real-time insights and decision-making                    | May lead to repetitive responses or fallback when encountering unknown queries |
| **Escalation Need**                | Rarely required, as AI agents handle a wide range of scenarios autonomously                 | Frequent for complex queries outside of defined responses                      |

## App vs Cloud

When it comes to building AI bots, Yellow.ai offers two powerful options: **cloud.yellow.ai and app.yellow.ai**.
- **App.yellow.ai** is our code-based platform, catering to users who prefer a more hands-on approach. It offers a drag-and-drop interface that empowers users with advanced customization options and full control over their bot's behavior. This platform is ideal for developers or businesses with specific coding requirements or the need for highly tailored bot functionalities.
- **Cloud.yellow.ai** is our no-code platform, designed specifically for those who want to create bots and automate processes without writing a single line of code. With its intuitive interface and user-friendly features, you can easily design and deploy AI bots, regardless of your technical expertise. Say goodbye to complex coding and hello to simplicity and efficiency.


While both platforms enable you to create and deploy chat bots, there are distinct differences that make the cloud.yellow.ai platform the recommended choice for many businesses, such as: 
- Accessibility and ease of use
- Accelerated development workflow
- Flexibility and agility
- Seamless collaboration
- Continuous innovation

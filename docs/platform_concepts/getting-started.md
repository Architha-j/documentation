This platform is ideal for developers or businesses with specific coding requirements or the need for highly tailored bot functionalities. All the new features will only be available on cloud platform.

With its intuitive interface and user-friendly features, you can easily design and deploy AI bots, regardless of your technical expertise.

    - Accessibility and ease of use
    - Accelerated development workflow

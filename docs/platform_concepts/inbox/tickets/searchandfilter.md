## <a name="1"></a>  3. Search for/within a ticket 

:::note
* **Admins** have the ability to search for any ticket.
* **Collaborators** and **supervisors** can only search for tickets that were created within the group they have access to.
* **Agents** can only search for tickets that they have been assigned to or resolved.

The search functionality offers two search categories:

1. **Ticket details**: This category allows you to search for email subject, ticket ID, customer's email ID, custom fields (except the type [number and date](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/inbox-settings/workflows/chat_custom_fields#-21-types-of-custom-fields)) and other details related to the ticket.
2. **Message details**: This category enables you to search for specific keywords contained within the email body.

The search feature provides several options, like:

* **Recently searched** keywords will appear when you access the search bar.
* The **top five results** related to the keyword within the ticket details will be displayed when you enter a keyword into the search bar.
* Click on **Try message search**, to conduct a keyword search within the email body directly. 
* Click on **See all results**, to view all the search results related to the keyword entered.

### 3.1 Ticket and message details search results page

Upon clicking **See all results**, you will be directed to the results page, where you can choose to view the matches found in either the **Ticket** details or **Message** details. 
- The screen will **highlight** the entered keyword in yellow, allowing you to easily identify the matches. Examples of highlighted matches include the ticket ID, message body, and more.

- The **filter** operation is integrated with the search functionality. It allows you to add filters or quick filters (Group, Agent name, and Ticket status) to the search results (only for ticket details), which can help refine your search further. 
    > These filters are added only for the search results. They can be deleted by clicking **Clear filters**.

- In addition to filtering and searching, the results can also be **sorted** based on date. By default, the results are sorted based on the last modified date in decending order to easily access the recent tickets.

**Point to remember:**

* Text entered within Search should be less than **50 characters** in total. 
* You can search for blanks "" in ticket search. 
* You can only search for keywords that are at least 2 characters long within **Message search**. For instance, typing "t" won't yield any results, while "tes" will.
* Search keywords are not case-sensitive, meaning that the search results will be the same regardless of whether the characters are in uppercase or lowercase.
* If you search for multiple keywords, such as "test reply," the search results will include tickets that contain either "test" or "reply," or both.

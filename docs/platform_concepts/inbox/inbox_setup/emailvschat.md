Depending upon the business use case, Inbox can be configured to handle email tickets or live chat. Few comparasions of email vs. chat are mentioned below: 

|  Live chat| Email tickets |
|--|--|
|Synchronous form of communication|Asynchronous form of communication|
|In this case, the bot user is actively present in the bot (WhatsApp bot, web bot, etc.) and is expecting a response to the raised queries in real time |This allows customers/ brands that are using the bot to provide support for a lot of customers in a situation when they are not required to respond instantaneously |
|Inbox live agents are immediately available to provide support and resolve these queries in a short period (10-20 minutes)|Industry practices could be to respond in a few hours or days|
|Expect immediate responses. Since a lot of queries are handled in a short span, SLAs are imposed expecting live agents to meet a target|This allows the brand to handle more volume of queries and provides the freedom to provide a delayed response depending upon the capacity|

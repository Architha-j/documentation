| **Response time trends** | Monitoring response time trends helps assess the efficiency of agent interactions with customers. Admins can track the average first response time and average reply time to identify any patterns or changes over time. This data is available in **First response time** and **Average reply time** for the last seven days. |
| **Agent performance** | Admins can monitor the performance of individual agents by reviewing metrics such as average handling time and the number of resolved chats. On the widgets you can see average handling time for the last seven days and the total number of resolved tickets.|
| **Customer wait time** | Tracking the average wait time for customers before connecting with a live agent is crucial for optimizing the customer experience. Admins can monitor the average wait time to identify any trends or potential issues. This data can be found in the graph highlighting the average wait time for chats.|
| **Tag based chat analysis** | Admins can utilize the tag filtering option to analyze specific chat tags. By selecting a tag from the dropdown, they can filter chat details and review metrics related to specific topics or categories. This allows admins to monitor chat trends and performance based on specific tags assigned during chat creation. |

We're excited to introduce significant improvements to the mobile app interface, enhancing your overall chat experience across different types.

**Before:**

| Description | User interface |
| -------- | -------- |
| **My Chats** page featured three tabsâ€”**Assigned, Open**, and **Archive**. <br/> <br/> - Filtering for specific chat types, such as *Resolved* chats, required navigating through the **Archive** chats tab. <br/> - Agent filtering could only be applied to chats within the archived segment. | <img src="https://imgur.com/RijlIK0.png"  width="50%"/> |




**Now:**

We've streamlined the interface to create a unified **Chats** page. No more distinct tabs; instead, a dropdown provides easy access to various chat types, including **My chats, Active chats, Queued chats, Resolved chats, Missed chats**, and **Open chats**. Here's what's new:

- **Default view:** Upon entering the **Chats** page, the default view is **My Chats**, displaying all chats assigned to the respective agent.
- **Enhanced navigation:** Chats selection and filtering options have been repositioned for a more intuitive and seamless experience, aligning along the same horizontal level.
- **Unified filters:** **Date, Source, Tags, Groups**, and **Agents** filters are now available for all chat types. However, the **Agents** filter is exclusive to **Active** chats and **Resolved** chats.

**Role-Based Access:**
Different chat sections are now available based on user roles:

| Role        | Available chats                                     | Default selected chat type                   | Reply permissions                                                |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent       | My Chats, Resolved Chats, Missed Chats, Open Chats   | My Chats                                   | Can reply only to assigned chats in My Chats                      |
| Admin       | Active Chats, Queued Chats, Resolved Chats, Missed Chats, Open Chats | Active Chats                               | Can reply to any chat in Active Chats                            |
| Agent + Admin | My Chats, Active Chats, Queued Chats, Resolved Chats, Missed Chats, Open Chats | My Chats                                 | Can reply to assigned chats and any other active chats in My Chats|

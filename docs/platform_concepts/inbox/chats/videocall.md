Text-based communications have limitations when dealing with complex issues to offer personalized support. it takes a lot of time and effort to provide an effective resolution. 
To resolve this complication, Inbox provides the option of video calls. Video call provides humanized digital customer experience. Other advantages of video calling are: 
- It is easier to achieve a meaningful interaction with the customer face to face (compared to a live chat or an email).
- It helps provide in-person support from anywhere across the world. 
- It improves customer satisfaction, increases the efficiency of the team's fast and stick resolution, boosts sales, and increases the trust with the customer.

:::note
Video call feature will only work once the bot and agent are configured for it. Refer to [video calling settings](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/inbox-settings/workflows/video-call-settings) for the steps to configure it.

In this article, you will learn how video calling works for agents vs. customers.


## Video calling workflow 

Agents can tend to their customer, share their screen, focus their products, provide consultation and superior customer experience, with a click of a button by using the video calling feature.

While resolving a query on live chat, Agents/customers might encounter instances where the solution is dependent on understanding the query through video call. For example: to fix a WIFI modem. In these situations a video call can be initiated. 

> This switch from live chat to video call is possible when the **Video call** option is selected on the Raise ticket node. 

- On the customers side the call option(icon) is disabled by default (unless **Voice call** is enabled within Raise ticket node). 
- When the call icon is enabled, customers can request for a video call, agent gets notified, agent can join the video call and understand the query. 
- Similarly, when an agent wants to understand the customer query better, they can request for video call and the customer can join the video call.

:::note
Resolving a query on video call does not mean that the live chat is resolved. After disconnecting the video call, the agent must resolve the live chat by clicking the **Resolve** button on the chat screen.

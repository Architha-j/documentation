sidebar_label :  Resolve/ transfer/ reopen chat 
---

Admin and agents have the ability to **resolve** or **transfer** a live chat and **re-open** a missed/resolved chat by clicking the corresponding button at any point during the conversation. 

----
## 1. Resolve/transfer a live chat 

Agents can click **Resolve** to close the live chat after providing a solution.        
Agents can click **Transfer** when they are unable to provide the required solution and the next agent can take over.

In some instances, inbox admins may require agents to fill in specific details before resolving or transferring a chat. 
If this is the case, refer to this article for more information.

- To resolve/transfer live chats, required custom fields must be entered on the user details. In the below image, **Order ID** is the custom field that must be entered to transfer/resolve this chat.

- Agent can **Transfer** a live chat,
    - **To a particular [Group](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/inbox-settings/team/groups)**: If the query is of a particular topic and it is transfered to a group, it is auto-assigned to any available agent of that group.
    > The numbers visible in the brackets next to the group names are the total number of agents available in that group. 
    - **To a particular [Agent](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/inbox-settings/team/agents)**: If this query can be resolved only by the selected agent/want a particular agent to address this chat, select the agent's name. The live chat will be force transferred to that agent (even if they are offline or the concurrency is full).

## 2. Re-open a missed/resolved chat

Any chats can be re-opened, by clicking the **Re-open** button on the **missed chat or resolved chat** screens and providing mandatory details such as **Priority** and **Description**.
The **re-opened chats will be created as new chats** and will be auto-assigned to an available agent (when it is not assigned to a particular agent, otherwise it will land in the My chats page of the selected agent).

## 3. Adding collaborators vs. Transfering live chat


| Collaboration | Transfer |
| -------- | -------- |
| Add collaborator when you want your colleague/manager to help you resolve your query.  | Transfer chat when you are unable to answer the query and you would want another agent to take over this chat. |
|- You (inbox agent) and the collaborators (other agents who are invited to this chat) can respond to the customer. <br/> - For a customer, this will look like a normal(uninterrupted) agent-customer interaction.<br/> - On the agent's side, there could be multiple agents providing the resolution/responding to the customer. <br/> - The collaborator(other agent) will have access to the chat screen and they can respond directly to the chat, or, add **Notes** for the assigned agent to refer (agents can also communicate with each other through internal notes). | When you transfer a chat, you will lose access to this chat and the chat (along with your conversation) will be transferred to the next available agent/ selected agent.     |
|**Example**: When a query has been raised that is assigned to an agent who resolves chats of the category:**Shipping and delivery**. While having a chat, the customer asks a question about **Payments**. A collaborator can be added to help with the question about payments. Once it is answered, the collaborator can leave and take over their chats.|**Example**: A chat enquiring **Payments** has to be assigned to an agent resolving queries related to **Returns and Refunds**. In such case, the chat can simply be transferred to **Payments & Pricing** group. |

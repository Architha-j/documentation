The Chats section covers all the aspects of synchronous real-time conversations between a bot user and the agent. It is an omnichannel dashboard that supports chats on more than 15 different [channels](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/channelConfiguration/overview).  
- Any incoming live chat (from any channel) will be assigned to a particular inbox agent only when the inbox agent is **Available**.

> Know more on default agent statuses [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/inbox_setup/agentstatuses).     
> Know more on chat assignment logic [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/inbox_setup/assignmentlogic)

:::note
Live chats are assigned only to an **Inbox agent** (although **Inbox admin** will have the permission to see and contribute to  the [operations](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/inbox_setup/roleaccess) in Inbox).
- For an inbox admin, all the chats/tickets will be accessible.  
- For an inbox agent, only the chats/tickets assigned to them will be accessible.

## 1. Types of chats

When a live chat is raised by the bot user (requesting to connect with an agent), that chat will be displayed under this section. 

:::note
- Only the **My chats** tab gets updated in real-time as and when the conversation occurs. Other chats are not updated unless the page is refreshed.
- When the customer name is available on the platform (User 360) or it is collected via Raise ticket node, the name will be displayed on the chat. Otherwise, a dummy customer name will be auto generated by the system.

Inbox classifies live chats into 7 different types, explained below:

> To learn how to build a flow that will raise a ticket to a live agent, click [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/inbox_setup/inboxdemo).  
> To view chats, Open Inbox > Chats. Select from the Chat types dropdown. 


### 1.1 My Chats

Inbox agents with the status as **Available** will be assigned live chats based on the [auto assignment logic](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/inbox_setup/assignmentlogic). 
These chats assigned to the respective agents will be displayed under My chats.
My chats will differ from agent to agent because they can only see the live chat assigned specifically to them. 

### 1.2 Active Chats

This chat option will be available/visible only to the users who are inbox **Supervisor/Admin** (Overall), where they can see all the active live chats that are being handled by the agents. Admins can monitor all the ongoing live chat from here.

### 1.3 Queued Chats

If either of the below conditions is true, the live chat raised will not be assigned to any agent in particular and it will be found under queued chats (only if [chat queues](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/inbox-settings/workflows/chat-queue) is enabled from the settings).

- If agent availability is **busy** or **away**.
- If the chat **concurrency** for each of the agents is full.


> For example:
> A limit is set that each agent can handle 5 live chats and there are 2 agents. 10 live chats are raised and they are in the assigned state.  In this case, when an 11th live chat is raised and the chat queues are enabled, it will be queued and found under queued chats.


Users will be notified with the position in which these live chats are in the queue. 
When any agent's status becomes available or the concurrency is changed, the live chat gets assigned automatically to an agent without any manual intervention. 

:::info

**Resolve queued live chat manually**

Advanced customers can have a dedicated supervisor who can keep a look at all the live chats. When a high-priority live chat moves to the queued list, the supervisor can assign it to any agent who can take immediate action.  
:::

### 1.4 Open Chats

When a live chat is incoming and there are no inbox agents available (inside or outside [working hours](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/inbox-settings/team/chat_working_hours)) to take this live chat, Open chats are created. 
Open chats will be automatically assigned to the agents when they log in/ become available when **Auto assign tickets** on [Offline handling setting](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/inbox-settings/workflows/offline-chat) is enabled. 

:::note
Generally, customers cannot request for live chats outside working hours unless [offline handling](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/inbox-settings/workflows/offline-chat) is enabled.
:::


### 1.5 Resolved Chats

All the live chats that are solved or **closed** by the agents will be found under resolved chats.
Admins can see all the resolved chats, while the agents can see only their resolved chats.

### 1.6 Missed Chats

When a chat is missed, it won't be assigned to any agent hence the resolution wont be provided to the customer. 
This is the ultimate fallback. When a chat doesn't belong to any other category of chats, it becomes a missed chat.
There are multiple ways in which a chat can move under missed chats. For example:  

1. When the Inbox settings hamper the experience of chats going into other categories. 
2. When the Raise ticket node (flow) is not configured correctly or raise ticket action fails due to Inbox settings that can be controlled (for example, if offline handling is disabled, group queue is not configured, etc.), the chat will be available in missed chats.
3. When Chat queue is not enabled in the Inbox setting, the incoming live chat that must be available under Queued chats moves into missed chats. 
4. When Offline handling is not enabled in the Inbox setting, the incoming live chat that must be available under Open chats moves into missed chats. 

> The chats do not move into missed chats for cases that are not controllable (like the bot server is down, technical error, bot shut down).

:::note
[Here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/inbox_setup/debugchecklist#understand-missed-chat-scenarios) are some additional reasons why chats can be missed.

### 1.7 Bot Messages

Bot messages are not assigned to any agents. Admins can use this tab to see the conversation flows. 

All the conversations that happen on the bot will be visible under bot messages (for admins and agents). This is an entire conversation that the user went through, irrespective of the live chat request raised. 
The purpose of this section is to monitor the bot responses (bot messages). If the conversation is not going as expected, agents can take the control over from the bot and converse with the user. 

> - For advance functionalities, you can see the [Conversation logs](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/analyze/chat-logs) in **Studio**. For example: To check if the bot is responding correctly, you can check the conversation logs.             
> - If you have only Inbox agents/admins access consult your bot admin for Studio access.

## <a name="cs"></a>  1. Chat conversation screen

You can chat with the customer on this screen. This screen has the following functionalities to enable easy conversations:

### Write a reply

Simply type in any text and hit send button (or enable enter to send if you want the messages to be sent when you press the enter key).

### Canned response

Canned response can be used to reduce the manual effort on sending frequent replies. Agent can simply select a canned response instead of typing the whole message multiple times and send it to the customer.  
You can add [configured canned responses](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/inbox-settings/productivitytools/canned-responses) from the dropdown by clicking **#**.   

> Canned responses can be searched by typing any relevant keywords. Learn more [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/inbox-settings/productivitytools/canned-responses).

### Internal notes

This can be used to take notes/jot down the pain points/summarise the chat sent by the user. It is mostly used before transferring the chat to another agent. 
The messages typed in internal notes will not be visible to the bot users. It will only be visible to the relevant agent (/admin) within the chat.

### Translate  

When [auto translate](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/inbox-settings/automation/chat_auto_translate) is configured, the messages sent by the users in regional languages are automatically translated to [Agent's default language](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/inbox-settings/team/agents#-1-agent-settings) (English by default) to the agents on the chat. Once the customers language is detected, the messages sent by the agent are translated to the customers language. 
- Any incoming language will be auto-detected by the system. You can also hardcode to translate only a particular set of languages. Once a foreign language is detected, Agents can identify the language at the top of their chat input box. If needed, agents can manually change the language.
 - All incoming and outgoing messages would be translated according to the agentsâ€™ and end-users preferred language. Agents can toggle and see both the original and translated message by clicking on the label - **Show translated / Show original**.
 - If for any reason, the agents want to send a generic message such as an address without being translated, they can disable the auto-translate toggle in the chat input box. This will stop translation for that message alone. After that message is sent, the toggle will automatically enable itself for the translation of the next message.


The toggle displayed in the below image is the language identifier. For example, if the user responds in French, the language in the toggle is updated to French. 

**Purpose of the translate toggle** (used in rare cases)          
Assume, the user has typed a sentence and the language is detected as French (using google translate) and updated on the toggle. The agent identifies this language to be Italian. The agent can change the language on the toggle for better translation.

### Save or share chats

Chats can be saved in CSV and PDF format to the local system. 
Chats can be shared with anyone by clicking the **chat copy URL** icon and sharing the link with the respective person.   

> Chats in this link will not be visible after 6 months.

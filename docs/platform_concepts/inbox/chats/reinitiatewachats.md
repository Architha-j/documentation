When a customer initiates a chat with an inbox agent on WhatsApp, the agent can respond for free within 24 hours of the customer's last message (referred to as the 24-hour Window). After this time, the WhatsApp chats are considered expired.

**After the 24-hour window**, if agents want to reinitiate an expired conversation, they must use approved **Message Templates** and will be charged at the applicable rate.

For instance, if agents cannot reply within 24 hours due to various reasons (extended resolution time, non-working hours, holidays, etc.), they won't be able to respond to the user after the window closes. In such cases, pre-approved message templates are used.

1. [What is the WhatsApp Business Policy for Inbox?](#policy)
2. [How to reinitiate expired WhatsApp chats?](#expchats)

In order to initiate a WhatsApp message to a person, you must first receive **opt-in permission** confirming that they wish to receive future messages from you on WhatsApp. The opt-in must clearly state the below conditions: 
- State that the person is opting in to receive messages from you over WhatsApp.
- State the business’ name. You may **only initiate chats using an approved Message Template** (as defined in our documentation), subject to applicable pricing. Any Message Template must comply with our terms and policies, and only be used for its designated purpose. We have the right to review, approve and reject any Message Template at any time.

:::note
If a person initiates a chat with you, you may continue that conversation via WhatsApp for up to 24 hours after the last message was sent to you by that person- without any charge (24-hour Window). 
**Outside the 24-hour window, you may only send messages via approved Message Templates**, for which you will be charged with the applicable rate.

## <a name="policy"></a>  1. Business policy for WhatsApp chats

Following are the rules followed as per the WhatsApp guidelines while handling inbox chats that are taking place on WhatsApp: 

1. **One can only initiate a conversation with the end-user using a pre-approved Message template, provided they have opted-in** for your business service or reached out to you first   
2. **If the end-user initiates the chat** with your business first, then **no opt-ins are required**     
3. **For every message** from the end-user in a conversation, **a 24 hr window will open** during which the **business can send both normal & template messages for free.**    
4. **Post the expiry of 24hr window** from the last end-user message, the **business will not be able to respond to the end-user without using approved message templates.**

:::info    
If you are not able to respond to the end user’s message within 24 hrs (if the chat ticket is taking too long to resolve, the chat ticket is created outside working hours or during holidays, etc.) you will not be able to respond to the end-user once the window is closed. 
In that case, you can send out the pre-approved message templates.

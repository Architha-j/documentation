The **Inbox Live Chat** screen provides agents with powerful generative AI features that can improve their customer service skills. These features include live chat summarization, the ability to modify message tone, and AI-powered suggestions for conversation enhancement. With these tools at their disposal, agents can offer more efficient and personalized support to customers, leading to higher satisfaction rates and better business outcomes.


## 1. Summarize chat conversation 

The **Summarize chat** AI feature provides a summary of the entire conversation between a customer and a bot or agent. This summary can be used to analyze the quality of support, customer satisfaction, trends, and more.

**Use-cases:** 
- Lengthy conversations may pose difficulties for agents to keep track of. This feature saves time by providing a summary of the user's chat with the bot.
- Agents and admins can evaluate the effectiveness of their responses to customer inquiries.
- Summarized chats can be utilized as a reference point for agents in the future if they need to refer to a previous conversation.

To access this feature, click on the **AI collaborator icon** and select **Summarize chat**.

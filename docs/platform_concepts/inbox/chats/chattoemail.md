In customer support industries, live chat serves as the default platform for rapid communication. However, certain complex issues may surpass the capabilities of Level 1 (L1) agents. In such cases, **Create a ticket** feature becomes a crucial tool, allowing L1 agents to seamlessly transition from live chat to a ticketed system.
By addessing the live chat an agent can convert the same query to an email ticket by clicking **Create a ticket**.  This feature facilitates a smooth process wherein L1 agents can extract essential information from customers, subsequently creating a ticket for in-depth analysis by Level 2 (L2) agents. 

**Create a ticket** option proves valuable in scenarios such as:
- Creating a ticket for internal analysis by L2 agents.
- Facilitating a threaded conversation between a different agent and the customer on the email channel.
- Recording the chat conversation and creating a ticket for reference.

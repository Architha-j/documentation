We're thrilled to launch the latest update to our inbox chat interface, designed to provide you with an even more seamless and efficient user experience. In our previous version, we identified several areas where improvement was needed to enhance usability and customer satisfaction. These changes address vital issues, such as navigation challenges and information hierarchy, while ensuring a consistent and responsive experience across all devices.

## What’s improved? 

1. **Streamlined navigation within chat details**

We've restructured the interface to ensure that you can effortlessly access the information you need, no matter how extensive the custom fields, website activity, timeline etc., are. This streamlined navigation not only enhances discoverability but also scales well to future additions, such as integrations, ensuring a smooth user experience.

2. **New Integration with User360: An in-house customer data platform**

Built-in integration with your in-house Customer Data Platform (CDP) provides a comprehensive 360-degree view of customer activities and data stored within our system. It offers a deep understanding of customer interactions, enabling you to deliver more personalized and effective support.

3. **Enhanced information hierarchy**

Our focus on improving the information hierarchy ensures that relevant data and actions are prominently placed. This optimization streamlines your journey within the platform, making it easier to find and utilize critical information.

4. **Improved responsiveness**

The new UI is now more responsive than ever before. Whether you're using a desktop, a small laptop, or a tablet, you can expect a seamless and responsive experience. Accessing our product is a breeze, regardless of your choice of device.

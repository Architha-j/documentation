## <a name="1"></a> 1. Custom field in chat/ticket details

**What are custom fields?**

Custom fields can be added to tickets and are used to track business-specific information related to the customer like Order ID, Address, case details, etc. These are customized fields created by the admin to obtain additional details based on the industry. Custom fields enable your teams to add more information and further context about a case, which helps with better reporting and faster resolution. 
- As per the configuration, Custom fields can also be used as mandatory fields to **Resolve/Transfer** a chat/ticket.

**Where can you find custom fields?**

11 types of Custom fields are available for both live chats and email tickets.

- On the [chat](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/chats/chatscreen#-2-user-details) screen, expand **Custom fields**. These are captured and passed to inbox via. **Raise ticket node > Advanced options**.

## <a name="4"></a>  4. Event to identify custom field inputs

When a custom field is updated in the platform, an event ` ticket-update` is triggered, with the `changeType` set as `change_custom_field`. This event can be captured and utilized by activating it in **Studio** on **Events**. 

> For steps to create and activate events, refer to [this article](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/events/event-hub#-8-custom-events).

By identifying the `ticket-update` event and custom fields associated with it, you can develop Studio flows to address various use cases. 
- For example: When you have a custom field called "Order ID" in the Inbox and it gets updated, you can create an automation flow on Studio that triggers an action to update the corresponding order details on your website.

This can help keep the information synchronized and save time by avoiding the need for manual updates.

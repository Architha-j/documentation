As a common practice in the support industry, the conversation between the live agent and the customer is sent to the customer (after the conversation ends) as a **chat transcript** that can be used as a reference for the customer. 

Yellow.ai's Inbox provides an option to send the chat transcripts.  Follow the steps below to enable chat transcript functionality: 

:::note
- To send the chat transcript to the customers, the customer email ID must be present on the platform (**Inbox > Chats > Contacts**).            
    - User/customer email ID can be fetched from the bot flows or the live agent can ask the customer for their email ID and add it in the [chat details](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/chats/chatscreen#2-user-details).                       
- If there is no email ID available on the **Contacts** field, the chat transcript will not be sent to anyone. 
:::


1. Open **Inbox** > **Settings**. 
2. Search and select **Chat transcript**.

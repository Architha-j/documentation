Yellow.ai's Inbox Email ticketing is a widely used approach that enables businesses and organizations to effectively handle customer inquiries, complaints, and support requests. It offers several use cases, including customer support, sales inquiries, IT support, bug reports, and complaints and feedback management. These applications allow companies to efficiently track the status of requests and provide timely updates to customers, employees, and users. 

**Email settings** must be enabled to handle support emails in the Inbox tickets module. 

:::note
**Prerequisites to no-code email ticketing**

3. Select **Support email**. Enabling the support email option means that all incoming emails will be forwarded to the yellow.ai Inbox instead of the actual mailbox, where they will be automatically converted into support tickets.

4. Add **Acknowledgement email for new tickets**. This allows an acknowledgement email to be automatically sent to the customer when a new support ticket is created in the inbox, while the inbox agent takes up the ticket to resolve the customer's query. This practice is widely used in the support ticketing industry. You can choose to not send an acknowledgement email by selecting the **Do not send acknowledgement email** option.

5. Add details and write the **Acknowledgement email**. 
    - **Subject** : Add `{{userSubject}}` to reply to the same mail or you can type a new subject to send the acknowledgement as a new email instead of a reply.
    - **Acknowledgement message**: You can make use of the options available on the response screen (explained [here](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/tickets/tickets_intro#22-email-response-screen)) and type a message. You can also use dynamic variables in the message, commonly used variables such as Ticket ID, User subject and User name can be included by clicking **Add** next to the name in ticket details.

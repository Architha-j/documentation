**CSAT (Customer satisfaction) score** is a numerical measure of customer satisfaction.      
Inbox admins can enable CSAT settings to track feedback of the customers after a **live chat** with an agent.

**Use case**     

CSAT setting helps you to measure how happy your customers are with agents and their service. If you want to retain more customers and increase customer lifetime value, it’s essential to keep customer satisfaction high by resolving their queries. CSAT helps you solve problems, prevent churn, and identify happy customers that can become your advocates and evangelists. It’s an essential step in the process of building customer loyalty, creating customer delight, and areas to excel, improve, and generate positive word-of-mouth.

**Sample CSAT**

- When an inbox admin enables CSAT and the agent clicks **Resolve** after the live chat is resolved, the user gets a message to rate the agent and the interaction. 
- A customer/bot user can select a number and rate the agent based on the interaction.   
- On Insights, admin can analyse the agent performance based on this score.

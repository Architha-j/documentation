When the agents need help (from their fellow agents or a superior/admin) with any of they query that they are responding to, they can add a chat/ticket collaborator. 
With this, the inbox agent or the collaborators (other agents who are invited to this chat/ticket) can respond to the customer queries.
On the collaborator settings page, Inbox admin can provide the permission to add collaborators based on the business use case to the inbox agents. 

- For a customer, this will look like a normal(uninterrupted) agent-customer interaction.
- On the agent's side, there could be multiple agents providing the resolution. 
- The collaborator(other agent) will have access to the chat/ticket screen and they can respond directly to the chat/ticket, or, add **Notes** for the assigned agent to refer. 

**Example use case:** 

A company handles queries on footwear and electronic accessories separately by creating two agent groups. If an agent from the footwear team is assigned to handle a chat query about footwear and while the conversation proceeds a question is raised by the customer about accessories and the agent is unaware of the solution, the agent can add a collaborator from the accessories team to this chat. The customer can interact with both agents and get the query resolved.

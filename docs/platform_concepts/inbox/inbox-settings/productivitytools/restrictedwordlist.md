The **Restricted word list** is a feature designed to ensure professionalism, maintain a respectful tone, and foster trust in customer communications. It consists of words and phrases that agents are strictly prohibited from using when interacting with customers. This helps avoid any language that could be offensive, disrespectful, dismissive, or harmful to the customer experience or the companyâ€™s reputation.

**Inbox Admins** can configure this list to prevent **Agents** from sending messages containing restricted words to customers.

## Configuration 

To add restricted words, follow these steps:

1. Open **Settings > Inbox > Productivity tools > Restricted word list**.

## Usage 

When an **agent** attempts to send a message containing any restricted word, the message will be blocked and not sent to the customer. A warning message will appear:  
**"Message not sent. Please review and try again."** The specific restricted word used in the message will also be highlighted.

> Any sentence or word containing a restricted substring will also be blocked. For example, if "dumb" is a restricted word, a term like "initdumb" will also be banned, and the agent will be unable to send the message.

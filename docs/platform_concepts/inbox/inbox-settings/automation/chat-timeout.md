**Chat inactivity**     
When a chat is assigned to an agent but neither the agent nor the customer has responded for a certain period of time, the chat is considered inactive and will eventually "timeout".     
Inbox admins can enable the inactivity trigger setting to identify these inactive chats.    
This can then be captured as an event called ```ticket-inactivity``` and further actions can be taken based on this event.

#### Use case of chat inactivity trigger

The inactivity trigger setting can be useful in cases where customers do not respond to a chat, as it helps to prevent wasted time spent on manual follow-ups by agents. This can lead to increased productivity for agents.

--------

## Configure event to identify chat inactivity 


**Open inactivity trigger settings**

1. Open **Settings** > **Inbox**.

**Features of inactivity triggers** 


The following are some key features of the chat timeouts which can be customized for different channels: 

- Inactivity from customer
- Inactivity from agent
- Auto ticket closure
- Do not close ticket

| Setting | Description |
|:-------- |:--------:|
| Inactivity from customer | (optional) This is a built-in setting to automatically trigger a **customer inactivity** event to timeout a customer if they have not responded to the agent's (bot's) reply on the chat for a while. You can check the box and set the duration in minutes.   |
| Inactivity from Agent | (optional) This is a built-in setting to automatically trigger an event to timeout an agent if they have not responded to the customers's reply on the chat for a while. You can check the box and set the duration in minutes. <br/>The event trigger for **agent inactivity** can be enabled and then configured within **Studio** to notify the customer when the agent is under heavy workload and there might be a delay in their response.|
| Auto Ticket closure | Checking this box will automatically close the chat (when there is no activity identified within the time period entered in the Channels settings below). |
| Do not close Ticket | This box can be set based on the tags present in the chat. A set of customised tags are available which you can choose from. You can choose not to close the ticket based on the presence or absence of a tag.|

- The default value is applicable to all the channels. The period set in it will be considered for Auto Ticket closure (when it is enabled).

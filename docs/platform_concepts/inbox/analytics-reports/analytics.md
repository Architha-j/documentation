In Inbox, analytics can be viewed and exported (as CSV files) for the following:

Chat analytics metrics are displayed based on their status time. For example, if there were two chats created on February 1st and resolved on February 2nd, the count for resolved chats will include both the chats from the previous day (February 1st) and the ones resolved on February 2nd.

2. **Agent performance**: Analyse [team performance metrics](/platform_concepts/inbox/analytics-reports/reports/chats/chat-report-metrics.md) and improve productivity.

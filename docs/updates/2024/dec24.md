## Streamline Customer Support with the New Workflows Module

We are excited to introduce the **Workflows module**, designed to automate routine tasks within your customer support operations. With this, you can automate various Helpdesk activities, schedule tasks for data teams, and improve overall operational efficiency. The workflows run independently from the core **AI Agent** flow and work seamlessly in the background, providing continuous support without interruption.  

This allows teams to focus on more critical, high-priority issues, improving overall productivity.

**Helpdesk-Specific Workflow Examples**  

1. **Send Ticket Details to CRM**: Automatically transfer ticket details to the CRM once an agent closes a ticket.
2. **Customer Acknowledgment**: Automatically acknowledge customers when a ticket is created, enhancing customer experience.
3. **Send Full Chat Transcript**: Seamlessly send the full chat transcript, including the URL, to the CRM when a ticket is resolved.
4. **Populate Custom Fields**: Trigger an API call to automatically populate custom fields (5-8) when an agent fills in one specific field.
5. **Journey Tagging**: Add journey-specific tags to chats, helping agents refer back to relevant customer journeys for better support analysis.


### Key Benefits

- **Routine Task Automation**: Automate various customer support tasks like managing Helpdesk activities, handling cron jobs, and more.
- **Background Operation**: Workflows function independently from the AI Agent flow, ensuring minimal disruption to daily processes.
- **Improved Productivity**: Free up time for your team to focus on high-value tasks, reducing the burden of routine work.


### Limitation of Workflow
The **Workflows module** currently supports **Helpdesk use cases only**.

## Unify Your Data with Table Joins in Custom Reports

**Merge Data with Ease**
* Combine or merge two default tables into a single report.
* Use Inner Join, Right Outer Join, or Full Outer Join to customize how data is matched and displayed.
* Flexible Query Creation

Explore the feature in **Insights** > **Data Explorer**. [Learn more](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dataexplorer/table_join)


**Use Case Example**

Easily identify users who raised tickets across multiple channels. For example, join the Chat Tickets and Email Tickets tables using the common column UID to track users engaging through both chat and email.

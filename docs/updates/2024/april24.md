## New Navigation on Cloud

Say goodbye to the old switcher and enjoy a fresh perspective on platform navigation. This new approach makes it easier to find whatever you're looking for.

- It reduces the time and number of clicks to reach from point A to B by approximately 50% (based on user testing).
- It also allows internal modules to be more discoverable, giving the user a holistic view of what they can do or access.
- Channels & Integrations have moved to a common placeholder called “Extensions”, making it easier to find and configure everything needed in one place.

## Introducing Orch LLM for seamless Goal Orchestration

 The orch LLM feature is now live on the cloud. The Orch LLM replaces our previous intent detection model and enables the model to orchestrate between multiple goals using gen AI prompts.

Here's what's in it for you:

1. **Zero Training:** No need for extensive training sessions. Simply describe the workflow, and the model will trigger the corresponding goal based on your description.

2. **Context Retainment:** Say goodbye to relying solely on the last user message. Orch LLM captures the entire context, ensuring the right goals are triggered accurately.

3. **Context Switching:** Managing multiple goals in one bot? No problem! This enhanced version of context switching ensures users are routed to the appropriate goals seamlessly.

4. **Small Talk Generation:** Engage users with natural, conversational responses, enhancing the overall user experience.

5. **Language Support:** Initially launched for English language bots, expanding language support is on the horizon.

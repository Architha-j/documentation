## Enhancements to Yellow.ai's Insights Module

We've revamped the Insights module to significantly enhance reporting capabilities based on valuable customer feedback. As a result, several screens within the module have been sunset, including Overview, Metrics, User Journeys, Voice Overview, and Doc Cog.

Previously, these screens provided informative but opaque reports, limiting users from performing custom drill-downs or modifying filters and visualizations. To address these limitations, we've introduced Dashboards and Data Explorer as the central features of the Insights module.

**Key Changes:**
- **Migration to Dashboards:** All previous reporting functionalities have been migrated to Dashboards within Insights.
- **Default Reports:** We've curated "Default Reports" accessible under "Created by Yellow.ai", providing transparent access to underlying data and parameters. These reports serve as a starting point for building custom queries or as ready-to-use insights.
- **Cloning Capabilities:** Users can now clone Default reports and dashboards to incorporate personalized drill-down operations.
- **New Use-Cases Covered:** Default Dashboards now cover Voice, Bot Performance, User Traffic, Inbox Chats, Inbox Agent Performance, Generative AI, and Email Tickets.

**Future Developments:**
- We're committed to expanding curated reports for various use-cases as we introduce new features and enhance data analytics capabilities.

**Improved Navigation:**
- All user-created reports and dashboards are consolidated in the "Custom" tab alongside our curated "Default" dashboards, streamlining navigation and enhancing usability.

This update makes the Insights module more intuitive, empowering users with enhanced customization and deeper insights into their data.


## Gain Instant Business Insights with Our Prebuilt Dashboards


Introducing Default Dashboards on the Dashboard page. These pre-built dashboards are designed to provide you with essential business insights quickly and efficiently. Each dashboard includes a variety of widgets that display critical data related to user traffic, inbox agent performance, voice interactions, bot performance, and inbox chats.

You can duplicate these dashboards to customize them further, but you cannot modify the default ones directly.

## The new and improved Insights module
We've revamped the Insights module to significantly enhance reporting capabilities based on valuable customer feedback. 

### Discontinued sections

We have removed the following screens from the UI:

* **Overview** 
* **Metrics**
* **User Journeys**
* **Voice Overview**
* **Doc Cog**

#### Reason for discontinuation

You might have noticed that while these reports were informative and accurate, they acted like black boxes when it came to the underlying raw data. You couldn't easily customize drill-downs, change filters, or adjust visualizations for specific metrics. That's why we decided to remove these screens and widgets to make everything more accessible on the Dashboard and Data Explorer pages.

#### Key upgrades

1. All Reports are migrated to [Default Dashboards](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/Dashboards/default_dashboard). 
2. Metrics/widgets are moved to default reports labeled as *Created by Yellow.ai*.
3. You can **clone** default reports and dashboards for personalized drill-down operations.
4. [Custom dashboards](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/Dashboards/custom_dashboards) and reports are available on custom tab.

> You will soon be able to setup **Custom alerts** on these reports.


### New and improved pages 

We've elevated the **Dashboards** and **Data Explorer** features to the heart of the Insights module. All the previous reporting users had access to has now been consolidated into the **[Default Dashboards](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/Dashboards/default_dashboard)** section of Insights. 

Don't worryâ€”every metric you used to refer to from those screens is still available on our platform, now organized under dashboards labeled **Created by Yellow.ai**.

**Default reports**

[Default reports](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/Dashboards/default_dashboard) give you access to the underlying data and parameters, allowing you to tailor them to your analytics needs. They can serve as a starting point for building complex queries or be used out of the box for basic insights. Additionally, you can clone our [Default Reports](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/Dashboards/default_dashboard) and Dashboards to incorporate custom drill-down operations.

Our Default Dashboards cover the following use cases:

* [User traffic](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dashboards#user-traffic)
* [Bot performance](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dashboards#bot-performance)
* [Generative AI](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dashboards#generative-ai)
* [Inbox chats](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dashboards#inbox-chats)
* [Inbox agent performance](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dashboards#inbox-agent-performance)
* [Email tickets](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dashboards#email-tickets-dashboard)
* [Voice](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dashboards#voice)

> We plan to support even more curated reports as we develop new features and expand our data and analytics capabilities.

**Custom reports** 

All reports and dashboards created by you are now available in one place under the **Custom** tab, alongside the Default dashboards curated by us. This makes the Insights module much leaner and easier to navigate.

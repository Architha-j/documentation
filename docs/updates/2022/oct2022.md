## 1. **Automation** 

#### 1.1 Download API logs 

| *Enhancement*


When there is an API issue, it is difficult to understand if our API calls are failing or if the client API is failing. To resolve this issue, we are storing all the API requests and responses to help establish the issues.   
[**Learn more here**](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/cookbooks/studio/downloadapilogs). 



#### 1.2 Bulk testing of utterances on cloud

| *New feature*


To test utterances, the Automation QA team had to check each utterance in the bot one by one. This is very time-consuming. To tackle this we have introduced a feature where users can bulk upload the utterances and test which flow/intent they are triggering.

To further enrich our out-of-the-box analytics present on the Overview page of Insights, we have added some new and enhanced data points on the dashboard which will help users better analyse bot and agent performance with much more granularity, and without manual calculations. The 4 enhancements are:
- **Messages bifurcation** - Messages metrics under **User Traffic** is now further bifurcated into Bot & User and Agent & User.  
- **Sessions bifurcation** - Sessions metrics is now divided further into Bot and Bot & Agent.  
- **Deflection rate** - Percentage of sessions handled solely by the bot without transferring to a live agent. It is a measure of chats resolved by self-serve.   
- **User feedback** - A new widget with an aggregate score of Bot CSAT and Agent CSAT on a scale of 1-5, along with percentage increase/decrease in the selected timeframe.

WhatsApp Product Message Support on Cloud Platform also known as the WhatsApp Catalog Support feature was available on the [App platform](https://app.yellow.ai) and is now available on the Cloud Platform. There are two new Nodes that were introduced which will be required to send Product Messages on WhatsApp from the Business Catalogs.

1. **Single Product Message**: This allows you to send a single product on a WhatsApp message with information like an image, description of the product, price, discounted price, etc.
2. **Multi Product Message**: Multi-product message allows you to send an expandable Vertical Carousal message with a maximum of 30 Products for the user to go through and add to the cart or view each product individually as well.

This feature opens doors to all the Business to have basic to complex E-commerce use cases and sell products right on WhatsApp. This is not only limited to physical goods but can also be used to showcase digital goods like Insurance, loans, etc.

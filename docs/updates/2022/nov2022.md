## 3. **Web widgets**

#### 3.1 Store the response of the Time node in the Date & Time picker, and Time picker cards in GTM format

Previously, user selection was saved in local time which would vary across regions. Currently, the Time node in Date & Time picker, and Time picker cards are saved in GMT to maintain the standard.

> These changes will be affecting the bots which are using the Date and time picker Card and Time Picker Card, not the web view.

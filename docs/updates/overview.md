## Engage

### Introducing Seamless WhatsApp opt-out information collection

Unwanted WhatsApp marketing can frustrate users, leading to blocks, impacting brand reputation and campaign effectiveness. Our solution ensures targeted outreach to those genuinely interested in your messages.

**How it works:**

1. Add the output element to the footer. The element includes the message Reply with STOP to unsubscribe.
2. If a user replies with "STOP," it updates the WhatsAppOptIn property in User360 to false for that specific user.
3. When you schedule an outbound marketing campaign, exclude opted-out users from your marketing list.

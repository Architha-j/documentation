## Gain Instant Business Insights with Our Prebuilt Dashboards


Introducing Default Dashboards on the Dashboard page. These pre-built dashboards are designed to provide you with essential business insights quickly and efficiently. Each dashboard includes a variety of widgets that display critical data related to user traffic, inbox agent performance, voice interactions, bot performance, and inbox chats.

You can duplicate these dashboards to customize them further, but you cannot modify the default ones directly.

## Enhanced Message Handling for Dynamic Chat Node

With this release, you can make use of the following enhancements: 

* **Send Initial User Message**: This Transmits previous user-bot conversations to the Dynamic Chat Node before transitioning flow control. If a user had asked for help with a particular issue in a previous conversation, when they enter the dynamic chat again, the bot can remind them of their previous request. This ensures continuity in the conversation and helps the user feel understood.
* **Send Message After Chat Ends**: After completing a dynamic chat session, the bot can send a closing message thanking the user for their interaction and inviting them to reach out again if they have any more questions or concerns. This leaves a positive impression and encourages further engagement.

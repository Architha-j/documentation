## Major enhancements to Insights Module

We've revamped the Insights module to significantly enhance reporting capabilities based on valuable customer feedback. As a result, we have discontinued the following sections: 
* **Overview**, **Metrics**, **User Journeys**, **Voice Overview** & **Doc Cog** pages.  

Earlier, these screens provided informative but opaque reports, limiting users from performing custom drill-downs or modifying filters and visualizations. 

We have removed these screens due to redundancies and low utilization rates, based on user feedback. This decision reflects our commitment to refining our interface and focusing on more impactful and relevant features to enhance overall user experience.


:::note
- We are working to build out a UI which will be useful for customers to not just visualise user drop-offs, but also measure containtainment rates effectively.

* **Voice Overview & Doc Cog pages**: 



 To address these limitations, we've made Dashboards and Data Explorer as the central components for Insights module. 

### Key Changes

#### 1. Reports migration to Default Dashboards

* All the reports that you were able to access earlier have been migrated to the **[Dashboards page](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dashboards)** of Insights.

#### 2. Default dashboards to cover various use-cases

-  Introducing **[Default Dashboards](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dashboards#default-dashboard)** that cover **[Voice](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dashboards#voice)**, **[Bot Performance](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dashboards#bot-performance)**, **[User Traffic](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dashboards#user-traffic)**, **[Inbox Chats](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dashboards#inbox-chats)**, **[Inbox Agent Performance](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dashboards#inbox-agent-performance)**, **[Generative AI](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dashboards#generative-ai)**, and **[Email Tickets](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dashboards#email-tickets)**.

#### 3. KPIs are moved to Default Reports
- The metrics (or KPIs) that were available on the sections mentioned above are now available in the Default Reports labeled as Created by Yellow.ai. These "Default Reports" allow users to access/customize underlying data and parameters to fit your analytics needs.

#### 4. Cloning capabilities

- You can now clone Default reports and dashboards for your personalized drill-down operations.


#### 5. Custom tab for custom reports and dashboards

- All user-created reports and dashboards are consolidated in the **Custom** tab, alongside our curated "Default" dashboards, enhancing usability within the Insights module. This keeps your key analytics centralized and readily available. Learn [how to create custom dashboards](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dashboards#create-custom-dashboards).


#### 6. Other enhancements
- You can customize these reports using no-code reporting tools.

- You will soon be able to setup Custom alerts on these reports.

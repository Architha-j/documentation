**Challenges in AI Agent Development**:

1. Understanding Agent Behavior
   * Why did the AI respond a certain way?
   * Why did it select a specific tool (e.g., KnowledgeBase, small talk, or a scripted workflow)?
   * What's the current status and goal of the conversation?
2. Inefficient Iterations
   * Switching between testing and editing prompts disrupts workflows and wastes time.
   * Lack of centralized configuration adds complexity to managing environments and features.

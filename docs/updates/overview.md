## Chat Widget

### Download transcripts for a comprehensive conversation record

Bot users can now effortlessly download chat transcripts directly from the chat widget. This functionality enables users to retain a copy of their interactions with the brand for future reference. They get access to their entire conversation history with the bot in a convenient plain text (.txt) format. The downloaded transcripts provide comprehensive details, including the bot's name, user's name, timestamp (displaying the full date and time), and all messages exchanged among the bot, agent, and user.

### Streamline widget styling accross all environments

You can now efficiently publish the **Widget Panel**, **Bot Icon**, and **Settings** options on the Chat Widget setup page, eliminating the need for repeated setup or updates across environments.

This is available for bots under the T3 subscription plan, specifically those with **Sandbox** -> **Staging** -> **Production** environments, and does not apply to T1 & T2 bots with **Dev** -> **Live** environments. For security reasons, the publication of Domain Whitelisting settings is excluded from this feature.

## Studio

### Enhance bot conversations with preview logs

In the **Preview** section, a new Debug option has been added. This tool shows logs of the tested conversation, including timestamps, IDs, and actions. Hover over the logs to access options that lead to specific nodes or logs. This helps you review and improve the bot-user conversations.

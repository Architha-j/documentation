### Sunset Notice: Clearing the Path for a Smarter Analytics Experience **![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Enhancement-ff9800)**

As we prepare for a major revamp of our Analytics module, weâ€™re streamlining the experience by removing a few legacy screens over the next two weeks. These updates are part of our broader effort to deliver cleaner insights, modern visualizations, and a more intuitive interface.

Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s changing:


#### Insights â€“ User Journeys

With the shift towards agentic AI workflows, this sectionâ€”based on an older implementationâ€”no longer aligns with our direction. Weâ€™re removing it, but donâ€™t worry:

* **Top Flows Visited** and
* **Journey Completion Rate** (will still be available in the **Overview** dashboard)

#### Insights â€“ Health

This screen is being taken down temporarily. In its place, weâ€™re working on a refreshed **Alerts** tab to provide a more actionable view into bot performance and system healthâ€”coming soon.

#### Engage â€“ User Data & User Trends

These screens havenâ€™t seen active usage since January 2025 and arenâ€™t tied to core workflows. To reduce clutter and focus on what matters, weâ€™re phasing them out.

#### Whatâ€™s Next?

Weâ€™re reimagining Analytics to support faster decision-making with smarter, cleaner, and more relevant insights. Stay tuned for upcoming releases with exciting upgrades.

1. To ensure consistency across the platform and enhance clarity, we've updated the following terms:
   * CR Rate â†’ AI Resolution Rate
   * Containment Rate â†’ Automation Rate
   * CR Opportunity â†’ Automation Opportunity
2. Each term now includes a tooltip definitionâ€”simply hover to learn more.

#### Layout Enhancements for Better Usability

To ensure faster access to actionable insights and smoother navigation:
* KB Recommendations and the Manual Conversation Analysis CTA have been moved to the top of the page.

## Knowledgebase

### Enhanced Knowledge base module **![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Enhancement-ff9800)**

We are excited to announce the launch of the new and improved Knowledge base module, now enabled by default for all newly created bots. This update introduces major enhancements designed to streamline how you manage, organize, and sync contentâ€”ensuring your AI agents always deliver accurate, context-aware responses.

**Whatâ€™s enhanced**:

* **Guided content onboarding**: Step-by-step onboarding for websites, document uploads, and third-party platforms.
* **Automated content syncing**: Schedule regular content updates using the built-in schedulerâ€”no backend configuration required.
* **Smarter file management**: Organize your content with folders, subfolders, and perform bulk actions for quicker updates.
* **Metadata management**: Tag and filter files to improve search accuracy and make content more discoverable for your AI agent.
* **Independent publishing workflow**: Publish Knowledge Base updates without redeploying the entire bot.

## Reintroducing Workflows for Helpdesk Automation


Support agents/admins spend significant time on repetitive, manual tasks that take them away from focusing on customer issues. Now, you can automate these time-consuming routines easily with our non conversational workflows builder. Get ready to simplify support workflows in minutes, with no technical expertise required.
**:sparkles: What’s New?**
**Simplified Event Handling**
Say goodbye to manually searching for the right event names, activating/deactivating them, using functions & dot notation to extract variables
**Now**: There are no inbox events under Events Hub. We’ve pre-built nodes for major usecases, and auto-generated variables for event data that you can easily use in the new Conditions node.


**Pre-Built Inbox Action Nodes**
No need to search and configure APIs to perform core inbox tasks!
**Now**: We’ve introduced ready-made action nodes for the most frequent tasks, like updating ticket status, transferring tickets, updating tags, custom fields, and more.

**New Time-Based Triggers**
Automate actions based on time conditions, unlocking scenarios that weren’t possible before.
**Now**: Set workflows to trigger after specific intervals, such as “Queued for X mins,” “Unresolved for X days,” or “Unassigned for X hours” etc.


**Upcoming changes:**

We’re just getting started! The first phase was to simplify support desk workflows. Here’s what’s on the roadmap to make workflows even more powerful:
* Expanding to More Use Cases: Soon, you’ll have a new experience of creating workflows involving CDP events, scheduled events, and more.
* Intelligent Nodes for Smarter Workflows: We’re working on adding advanced, intelligent nodes to unlock more complex automation capabilities.

With these upgrades, our Workflow Builder is evolving into a versatile tool for automating the entire customer support journey.
This feature is available for all bots running on the latest version of our executor. Give it a try, and let us know your feedback! Rest assured, all existing workflows built using inbox events will continue to function as expected.

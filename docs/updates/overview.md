## The new and improved Insights module
We've revamped the Insights module to significantly enhance reporting capabilities based on valuable customer feedback. 

### Discontinued sections

We have removed the following screens from the UI:

* **Overview** 
* **Metrics**
* **User Journeys**
* **Voice Overview**
* **Doc Cog**

#### Reason for discontinuation

You might have noticed that while these reports were informative and accurate, they acted like black boxes when it came to the underlying raw data. You couldn't easily customize drill-downs, change filters, or adjust visualizations for specific metrics. That's why we decided to remove these screens and widgets to make everything more accessible on the Dashboard and Data Explorer pages.

#### Key upgrades

1. All Reports are migrated to [Default Dashboards](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dashboards#default-dashboard). 
2. Metrics/widgets are moved to default reports labeled as *Created by Yellow.ai*.
3. You can **clone** default reports and dashboards for personalized drill-down operations.
4. [Custom reports and dashboards](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dashboards#create-custom-dashboards) are available on custom tab.

> You will soon be able to setup **Custom alerts** on these reports.


### New and improved pages 

We've elevated the **Dashboards** and **Data Explorer** features to the heart of the Insights module. All the previous reporting users had access to has now been consolidated into the **[Default Dashboards](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dashboards#default-dashboard)** section of Insights. 

Don't worryâ€”every metric you used to refer to from those screens is still available on our platform, now organized under dashboards labeled **Created by Yellow.ai**.

**Default reports**

[Default reports](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dashboards#default-dashboard) give you access to the underlying data and parameters, allowing you to tailor them to your analytics needs. They can serve as a starting point for building complex queries or be used out of the box for basic insights. Additionally, you can clone our [Default Reports](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dashboards#default-dashboard) and Dashboards to incorporate custom drill-down operations.

Our Default Dashboards cover the following use cases:

* [User traffic](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dashboards#user-traffic)
* [Bot performance](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dashboards#bot-performance)
* [Generative AI](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dashboards#generative-ai)
* [Inbox chats](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dashboards#inbox-chats)
* [Inbox agent performance](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dashboards#inbox-agent-performance)
* [Email tickets](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dashboards#email-tickets-dashboard)
* [Voice](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/growth/dashboards#voice)

> We plan to support even more curated reports as we develop new features and expand our data and analytics capabilities.

**Custom reports** 

All reports and dashboards created by you are now available in one place under the **Custom** tab, alongside the Default dashboards curated by us. This makes the Insights module much leaner and easier to navigate.

## Inbox: Information Security Enhancement to restrict Agent Actions in tickets

In our ongoing efforts to enhance information security and streamline operations within our ticketing system, we are adding a new security layer to restrict certain actions by agents. These changes ensure that only authorized personnel can modify ticket details and perform other ticket-related activities. This update applies to both chat tickets and email tickets.

### Key Changes
* **Agent Restrictions**: Agents will no longer have the access to:
   * Update ticket details of other agents or unassigned tickets.
   * Send messages on other agents or unassigned tickets.
   * Transfer tickets assigned to other agents or unassigned tickets to other agents.
   * Assign tickets that are either assigned to other agents or unassigned.
   * Perform any other ticket-related updates on tickets not assigned to them or unassigned tickets.

:::note
These restrictions apply to both chat tickets and email tickets.
:::

* **Group Supervisor Permissions** to allow group supervisors to effectively manage and oversee the tickets within their specific groups without unnecessary restrictions.
   * Agents with Group Supervisor access can continue to:
   * Update ticket details for tickets within their supervision group.
   * Send messages on tickets within their supervision group.
   * Transfer and assign tickets within their supervision group.
   * Manage unassigned tickets that belong to their supervision group.

* **Admin Rights**:
   * Admin users will retain all existing permissions and rights. Admins will continue to have full access to modify, transfer, assign, and perform all ticket-related activities regardless of the ticket's assigned status. These permissions cover both chat tickets and email tickets.

### Benefits
* **Enhanced Security**: By restricting agents from accessing and modifying tickets not assigned to them, we minimize the risk of unauthorized changes and potential security breaches.
* **Improved Accountability**: Clear demarcation of responsibilities ensures that agents are accountable for the tickets assigned to them, fostering a more organized and efficient workflow.
* **Effective Supervision**: Ensuring that group supervisors can effectively handle their team's tickets allows for better oversight and management within specific groups.
* **Simplified Workflow Management**: Admins retain full control over ticket management, allowing for efficient oversight and delegation.
Action Required
* **For Agents**: No specific action is required from agents. These changes will be applied automatically.
* **For Group Supervisors**: Supervisors should review their group's tickets and ensure they are aware of their permissions.
* **For Admins**: Admins should ensure that they are aware of the continued breadth of their permissions and use their rights responsibly to manage ticket assignments and transfers.

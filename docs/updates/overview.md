## Agent AI Copilot 

Agent AI Copilot si a powerful new feature designed to make building, testing, and debugging LLM-powered AI agents faster and easier!

Creating AI agents can be challenging, especially when:

1. We want to understand agent behaviour:
   - Why did the AI agent respond in a certain way?
   - Why did it pick a specific tool (e.g., knowledge base, small talk, or scripted workflow)?
   - What's the current status of the conversation?
   - Users often lack visibility into these decisions, leading to confusion and delays.
2. Inefficient manual switching:
   - Switching back and forth between testing agents and editing prompts wastes valuable time.

### What Copilot Brings to the Table
Complete Transparency: For every turn of the conversation, Copilot provides:
- The generated agent message.
- The reasoning behind it.
- The active tool or workflow being used.
- The current conversation status and goal progress.

### Seamless Editing and Testing: 
You can now make changes to prompts right on the same page and retest, drastically reducing iteration time.
With the centralised LLM Configuration Screen, in a single page, admins will be able to
- Create new LLM configurations.
- Assign different configurations for the different features in our platform which use LLM.
- Assign different configurations for different environments of the same feature if required.

+ Central LLM Configuration:
Along with this, maintaining LLM Configurations will also become more easier with a centralised UI.

## Enhanced Insights with Third-Party Transcript Analysis

Yellow.ai now supports the import and analysis of transcripts from third-party ticketing tools, providing deeper insights into agent-user conversations that were previously unavailable.  

---

## Offline Ticket Creation in Third-Party Tools

Until now, transcripts from third-party ticketing tools were not accessible on the platform. This meant that analysis was limited to interactions between users and AI agents, leaving out valuable insights from agent-user conversations.  

Offline tickets are generated in third-party ticketing systems under the following conditions:  
1. **Outside Business Hours**: When the inbox (Yellow.ai or third-party) is accessed while agents are unavailable.  
2. **Non-Inbox Scenarios**: When interactions bypass the inbox, leading to offline ticket creation.  

These interactions span multiple channels, including calls, emails, web chats, and SMS.  


### Key features 
With the latest update, transcripts from third-party ticketing tools will now:  
- Be imported into the platform.  
- Undergo analysis alongside existing interactions.  
- Display actionable insights in the **Analyze** module.

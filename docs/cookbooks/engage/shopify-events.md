## Cart abandonment recovery campaign {.tabset .tabset-fade}

### [Sample text](#tab/tab-a)

### [Sample text2](#tab/tab-b)


In an online store on Shopify, you notice that some customers abandon their shopping carts during the checkout process. To recover those potential sales, set up a Flow campaign to automatically send reminders to users who have abandoned their shopping carts on your Shopify store.


**Entry trigger**: `shopifyCartCreate` event

**Exception to trigger notification**: `ShopifyCheckoutCreated` event

**Flow configuration**:


1. **Trigger the flow**: Initiate the campaign when a user adds items to their cart, identify it using the `shopifyCartCreate` event.

2. **Wait condition**: Check if the user has completed the purchase by waiting for the `ShopifyCheckoutCreated` event. Set time delay, say 10 min. If no `ShopifyCheckoutCreated` event is detected within 10 min, proceed to the next step.

3. **Send abandonment reminder**:  If the user has not completed the purchase within the specified time, send a WhatsApp notification. Here is a sample message:

**FAQ: Resolving Template Sync Issues Between Meta and the App Platform**

**Q1: Why aren't templates created in Meta syncing automatically to the app platform?**

**A:** Templates created in Meta do not automatically sync to the app platform due to integration limitations. Manual entry is required to ensure templates are available for campaigns.

**Q2: How do I manually add a template to the app platform?**

**A:** To manually add a template, follow these steps:

1. **Create the Template in Meta:**
   - Use your WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) access to create the template in Meta.

2. **Open the Engagement Module in the App Platform:**
   - Go to the engagement module and select "Create Campaign."

3. **Set Up a Test Campaign:**
   - Choose a test audience and segment.
   - Skip the senderâ€™s field mapping option.

4. **Add the Template Manually:**
   - When prompted to select a template, note that the Meta-created template will not appear.
   - Click "Add Template" to enter it manually.

5. **Enter Template Details:**
   - **Template Name:** Enter the name in lowercase (copy and paste from Meta).
   - **Content:** Copy and paste the content exactly as it appears in Meta, including all spacing.
   - **Namespace:** Obtain from Meta under the "Manage Template" options.
   - **Parameters:** Enter the number of parameters used in the template.
   - **Media:** Check if the template includes media and select the appropriate media type.
   - **Quick Replies:** Specify the number of Quick Reply (QR) buttons and choose between QR or Call to Action (CTA) buttons.
   - **Language:** Set the language according to the template (e.g., "en" for English, "hi" for Hindi).

**Q3: What should I do if the manual addition of the template does not work?**

**A:** If the manual addition fails:

- Double-check all details for accuracy.
- Verify that all required fields are filled correctly.
- Contact our support team for further assistance.

**Q4: Is there a way to automate or improve the sync process?**

**A4:** Currently, automatic syncing is not available. Manual entry is necessary until improvements are made to the integration system. Watch for updates on potential enhancements to the sync process.

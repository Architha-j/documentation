   iii. Provide a relevant name for the intent and add "DND" and "unsubscribe" as Uttrences.
   iv. Click **Add** to save the intent.

3. Use the [Variable node](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/action-nodes-overview/variables-node)  to [update the relevant user property](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/user_data/store_conv_data), in the following example, the `campaignOptIn` property is set to `false`. This ensures that the customer's optout status is captured and stored in User 360.

4. [Create a user segment](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/user_data_segments/segments_overview) excluding opted-out users. 

    Add a condition to include users whose `campaignOptIn` status is `true. `Use this updated property as a condition in segment targeting to exclude users who have opted for DND from receiving further campaign messages.

5. When [setting up your campaign](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/outbound/outbound-campaigns/run-campaign), make sure to exclude opted-out users using the segment you created. This ensures that users who have opted for "STOP" or "DND" will not receive any further campaign messages.

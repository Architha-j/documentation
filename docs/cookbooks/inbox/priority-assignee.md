In this article, you will learn how to change the **priority** of a chat/email ticket and **transfer** it from one inbox agent to another. 

----

#### Configure priority and group on the Raise ticket node 

- While creating flows (on Automation) using [Raise ticket action node](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/action-nodes-overview/raise-ticket), the bot builder can assign a priority to the chat/email tickets. Tickets created through this flow will have the assigned **Priority**.

- You can configure Priority in the action node by enabling Advanced options. In the below example, all the tickets created will be assigned to the Complaints Department (configured in [group settings](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/inbox/inbox-settings/team/groups) and the priority is High.

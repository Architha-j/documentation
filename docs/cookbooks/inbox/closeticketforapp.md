When agents cannot see the *Close ticket options* on the app screen while closing tickets, follow these steps:

:::note
**Prerequisite**:
Add **group codes** to the close ticket options based on agent groups.
:::

1. Check for groups: Verify if there are any groups created within the system.
2. Agent group assignment: Ensure that the agent experiencing the issue is added to a group. If the agent is not in a group, add them to the appropriate group.
3. Verify close ticket options: 
    - If the agent already belongs to a group, check the Close ticket options.
    - Review the groups assigned to each Close ticket option.
    - Add the relevant group names to the settings for each Close ticket option.
4. Visibility settings: Ensure the checkbox for Close ticket options to be visible while resolving tickets is ticked.

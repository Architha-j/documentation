**Missing bot response** can be rectified by opening the conversations, finding the point where the bot response was missing, and configuring a fallback or adding a message to the node, if empty.

1. Click **Missing bot response**. You will be directed to the conversation log page that consists of the conversations that encountered missing bot responses. 
2. Open any conversation. Select the **Missing bot response** to identify the exact point. 
3. Hover over the text, click on the menu options, and select **Go to node**. 
4. You will be directed to the respective flow, modify the flow by adding a fallback/new message as per your use case.

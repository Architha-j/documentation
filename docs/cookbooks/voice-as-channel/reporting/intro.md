If you're using a voice agent, tracking your metrics is essential for achieving the desired results. Yellow's platform offers comprehensive tracking to give you complete insights into your voice agent's performance.

## 1. Voice reports available on Insights

You have two options to track your voice data:

1. **Basic Reporting**: The platform automatically tracks common points from the voice conversation and displays them on the [Voice Overview Dashboard](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/cookbooks/voice-as-channel/reporting/dashboard) on Insights module. From the dashboard, you can:
    - Retrieve the total number of calls received in the past week.
    - Retrieve the average duration of calls for the previous 30 days.
    - Retrieve the answering rate for the outbound campaign during the last quarter.

2. **Advanced Reporting**: You can track voice agent analytics on Insights based on your specific needs in the following ways:
    1. [CDR reports](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/cookbooks/voice-as-channel/reporting/cdr): View more than 15 voice call parameters on the **Call Details Report** (CDR) in the Data Explorer. From the CDR report, you can:
        - Retrieve a list of users who disconnected calls during the last 7 days.
        - Retrieve the answering rate for a specific campaign (identified by its ID) that was launched last Sunday.

    2. [Conversational details reports](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/cookbooks/voice-as-channel/reporting/convdata): **Design custom flows** to track the specific information you need from the customer, save it in a database, and visualize it. From the conversational details report, you can:
        - Retrieve the percentage of callers who are selecting the Hindi language option.
        - For an e-commerce chat agent, retrieve the percentage split between inquiries related to order status and those related to registering a complaint.

    3. [CDR X Conversational details report](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/cookbooks/voice-as-channel/reporting/conv_cdr): Use **complex queries** to combine **Call Details Report** (CDR) and **conversational data** and create custom reports. From this report, you can:
        - Retrieve the average handling time for calls in the Hindi language.
        - Compare the average handling times of calls for use case A versus use case B in the voice agent.

Further articles provide detailed explanations of these use cases.

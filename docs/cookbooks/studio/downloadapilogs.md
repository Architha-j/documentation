When there is an API issue, we donâ€™t know if our API calls are failing or if the client API is failing. To resolve this issue we are now storing all the API requests and responses which will help establish the issues.

**How to use this log data?**

- There are multiple issues arising out of API failures. In these cases, we are not aware if calls from our platform are failing or if there are issues with customers' API only. You can download the data in this case and see some past requests and responses to establish what is the actual root cause.
- If the date and time of an incident of failure are known, then you can select the respective date and download the data. In the downloaded data search for the respective time and check the requests and responses.
- For better readability you can use tools like **VS code**, **jupyter notebook** etc.


## 1. API Logs data

API logs data stores all the API data like requests, responses, etc. The data would be available for requests sent from the [API Node](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/nodes/action-nodes-overview/api-node) only.
API download data would contain this information:
* API Name
* API Requests
* API Response
* Requests Timestamp 
* Status Code (Failed/Success)
* Userid


## 2. Download API Logs

Follow the given steps to download the API logs:

1. Open **Automation** > **API** tab.

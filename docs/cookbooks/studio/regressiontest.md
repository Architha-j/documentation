Instead of creating utterances manually, you can now auto-generate them and run test utterances in bulk. Before publishing, you can test these utterances to check whether each one is mapped to the respective intents.

To try this, 

1. Go to **Automation** and click **Test bot**.

4. To test all the other intents, click the back arrow(on the top left next to the intent's name) and click **Test Intents**. 

This action will test the utterances for all the intents and give the status regressively. It's useful when you are making changes to your bot. You don't have to test each and every change, with a click you can collectively train the bot on all the changes.

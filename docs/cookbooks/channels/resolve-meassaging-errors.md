This guide provides steps to identify and troubleshoot message failures when using WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram channels. 

Message failures can occur due to various reasons such as incorrect configuration, network issues, or platform limitations. Understanding the specific cause of message failures helps in timely resolution and maintaining effective communication.

##### Prerequisites

To troubleshoot message failures, ensure you have the following:

* Access to the Yellow.ai platform.
* Permission to view message logs and configuration settings.
* Knowledge of the specific channel (WhatsApp, Facebook, or Instagram) where the failure occurred.


### Steps to resolve message failure

1. Navigate to the bot where the message failure has occurred.

2. Copy the chat transcript of the userâ€™s WhatsApp number for which the message was not delivered.

3. Open the copied chat transcript in a new tab.

4. Open the **Network** tab > right-click on the page > select **Inspect**.

5. Go to the **Network** tab to monitor network requests.

6. Look for an API call with the name signature in the network logs.

7. To analyze the error message, open the API in a new tab and search for the message where the failure occurred.

8. Identify the error message or reason for the failure.

**Example of error and resolution**

By following these steps, you can determine if the issue is related to the bot configuration or requires escalation to the platform or Meta team.

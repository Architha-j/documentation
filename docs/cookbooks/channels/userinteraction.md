You can monitor user interactions within the widget by tracking clicks on links within text messages (message-hyperlink-clicked), card buttons (card-cta-clicked), and banner buttons (banner-cta-clicked). When a user clicks on any of these components, an event is triggered, and the relevant information is stored in the **Event** column for analysis and insights.

To track link clicks in Chatbot components, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Insights** > **Data Explorer** > **User engagement events**.
